<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 11 (IANS) Except the romantic French who prefer 'heart' emoji, people worldwide love the 'grin' emoji the most, reveals new research that looked at 427 million messages from nearly four million smartphone users in 212 countries.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Grin' is the most popular emoji, comprising 15.4 per cent of the total symbols in the study, followed by 'heart' and 'love' emojis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using a popular method app, &amp;quot;Kika Emoji Keyboard&amp;quot;, available in 60 languages, researchers from University of Michigan analysed millions of messages to see if emoji use was universal or differed based on user location and culture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Emojis are everywhere. They are becoming the ubiquitous language that bridges everyone across different cultures,&amp;quot; said Wei Ai, doctoral student at University of Michigan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twenty per cent of messages of French include at least one symbol, followed by Russians and Americans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Countries with high levels of individualism use more happy emojis. Countries where ties between individuals are integrated and tight use more emojis expressing sadness, anger and negative feelings,&amp;quot; the findings showed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As French are perceived romantic, they mostly use &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; emojis while people from other countries prefer face-related emojis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our report shows that users from different countries can have various preferences to use emojis. The rank of emojis shown in the input methods should be country-aware to users,&amp;quot; said associate professor Qiaozhu Mei.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, presented at Ubicomp conference 2016 in Germany recently, input methods could be developed to suggest relevant &amp;quot;next-to-use&amp;quot; emojis to users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Las Vegas, Jan 11 (IANS) Not just smartphones, convertibles or cameras, it was time for ground-breaking products in 5G technology, self-driving vehicles, digital health, Artificial Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), robotics and machine learning to be showcased at the world\'s biggest annual electronics event here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As CES 2017 celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, the mega electronics event was also a record-breaker in hosting more than 600 startups and more than 175,000 industry professionals -- including 55,000 from outside the US. 

\&amp;quot;Our industry is helping the world improve through connectivity and innovation, touching literally every facet of our lives. Today\'s connected world was on full display at CES 2017 -- our largest, boldest show in history,\&amp;quot; Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told IANS.

The event also showcased the connected future of technology with more than 3,800 exhibiting companies and exhibit space of more than 2.6 million net square feet.
 
\&amp;quot;This year\'s show was all about connectivity -- both in the form of the technologies unveiled and in the valuable face-to-face business connections happening throughout the show,\&amp;quot; added Karen Chupka, Senior Vice President, CES and corporate business strategy, CTA.
 
In the field of connected cars, Intel showcased a system with Microsoft Hololens (augmented reality headset) that sent signals to the Cloud via 5G and received commands from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, taking decisions for automatic driving.
 
\&amp;quot;What you see here is all that needs to come together for automated driving to come a reality. At the Intel automated driving experience, the car has the sensors that are collecting information and processing it to recognise everything in its surroundings,\&amp;quot; an Intel exhibitor at the booth told IANS.
 
In a perfect vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the car could also connect with the traffic lights which, in turn, gives less traffic congestion and safe automated driving experience with very less or no accidents.
 
\&amp;quot;CES 2017 was a global showcase that demonstrated that we are in a new era of innovation where technology is valued not just for the devices it produces but for the experiences it makes possible,\&amp;quot; Bridget Karlin, Managing Director, IoT, at Intel, told IANS.
 
Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Blackberry and QNX Operating Systems, Mitsubishi and Mercedes also showcased their electric and hybrid cars.
 
The US glass manufacturing company Corning introduced a car with Corning Gorilla Glass that provided toughness with a 30 per cent decrease in the vehicle\'s weight.
 
Chip manufacturer Qualcomm introduced its newest mobile platform Snapdragon 835 processor with X16 LTE modem, which will provide high performance and enhanced power efficiency.
 
Snapdragon 835 is designed to support next-generation entertainment experiences and connected Cloud services for premium consumer and enterprise devices.
 
The mobile platform is 35 per cent smaller in package size and consumes 25 per cent less power compared to the previous generation flagship processor Snapdragon 821.

Expected to revolutionise the connected world, 5G was a major focus throughout CES.

\&amp;quot;CES 2017 was a coming out party for the future of 5G which, we estimate, will generate a net 20 million new jobs,\&amp;quot; Jim Mault, Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Qualcomm Life, told IANS.
 
Companies like Samsung, TCL and Hisense came up with 8K TVs -- with Samsung and TCL building the new platform on Quantum Dot technology that offers true RGB colour mixing, more durability and is energy efficient.
 
Samsung also unveiled its much-awaited Gear S3 Smartwatch.
 
While companies like Lenovo launched machines dedicated to gaming, the onus was on virtual (VR) games. Several companies launched products that support VR gaming.
 
The show also received a huge social media momentum, including nearly 1.4 million mentions using #CES2017 hashtags.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 11 (IANS) Charon -- Pluto's moon which is more than half its diameter and orbits only 12,000 or so miles away -- is slowing down the decay of Pluto's atmosphere, scientists have found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To put that into perspective, picture our moon three times closer to Earth and as large as Mars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology has provided additional insight into this relationship and how it affects the continuous stripping of Pluto's atmosphere by solar wind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Charon is positioned between the Sun and Pluto, the research indicates that the moon can significantly reduce atmospheric loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Charon doesn't always have its own atmosphere. But when it does, it creates a shield for Pluto and redirects much of the solar wind around and away,&amp;quot; said Carol Paty, associate professor in the school of earth and atmospheric sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This barrier creates a more acute angle of Pluto's bow shock, slowing down the deterioration of the atmosphere. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Charon doesn't have an atmosphere, or when it's behind or next to Pluto (a term scientists call &amp;quot;downstream&amp;quot;), then Charon has only a minor effect on the interaction of the solar wind with Pluto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study's predictions, performed before the New Horizons probe collected and returned data to Earth, is consistent with the measurements made by the spacecraft about Pluto's atmospheric loss rate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research was published in a special Pluto issue of the journal Icarus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 11 (IANS) Family members of three Americans who were killed in attacks by the Islamic State in the Brussels airport bombing in 2016 and Paris attack in November 2015 have filed a lawsuit against Twitter, accusing it of aiding the extremist group by ignoring its tweets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in RT on Tuesday, the lawsuit titled &amp;quot;Cain v. Twitter, Inc&amp;quot; has been brought forward by Anne Cameron Cain, whose husband Alex Pinczowski and his sister Sascha were killed in the 2016 Brussels Airport bombing, as well as Beatriz Gonzalez, the mother of Nohemi Gonzalez who was killed in the November 2015 Paris attack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The claimants alleged that Twitter was responsible for their relatives' deaths by providing terrorists a platform to spread their ideology and recruit new members. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is the first lawsuit that details how Twitter has played a key role in making Islamic State the most formidable terrorist organization in the world today, and how Islamic State uniquely used Twitter in the context of two of the most serious attacks to take place in Europe recently,&amp;quot; Shurat Hadin, Attorney Nitsana Darshan-Leitner was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The victims' families are seeking compensation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lawsuit notes an incident in October 2014 when an IS-linked account shared a message calling for the murder of civilians in France and other countries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also mentions how three days before the November 2015 attacks, IS-linked accounts posted images of guns, the Eiffel Tower and prayers for blessings on what they called their &amp;quot;mission.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;During the attacks themselves, IS tweeted using the hashtags #paris_ignites, #parisinflames, and #franceisonfire before publicly taking responsibility for the carnage. They repeated this pattern with the 2016 Brussels attack,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The plaintiffs accused Twitter of violating anti-terrorism laws by failing to take action against the accounts of IS and providing material support to the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter has been blamed earlier also for not taking any action against jihadist propaganda and stopping US intelligence agencies from monitoring terrorists activities on Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Since the summer of 2015, Twitter has been more vigilant towards IS-linked accounts, with a total of 350,000 users being blocked or suspended by August 2016. Nevertheless, the lawsuit alleges that as of January 2017, Twitter 'continued to provide these resources and services to ISIS and its affiliates, refusing to actively identify ISIS Twitter accounts, and only reviewing accounts reported by other Twitter users',&amp;quot; the report cited Business Insider as reporting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 11 (IANS) Apple's next generation bezel-less iPhone 8 is rumoured to sport a bold new design and would feature an OLED display full of holes, a media report said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The patent filed by Apple for 'Electronic devices having displays with openings' describes a method by which various components can be mounted behind perforations in a device screen that are so small as to be imperceptible to the human eye. This arrangement would allow engineers to design a smartphone or tablet with a true edge-to-edge, or full-face display,&amp;quot; appleinsider.com reported on Wednesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The openings may be located in the active portion of the display. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The display may be mounted in a housing associated with the electronic device. An electronic component may be mounted in alignment with the one or more openings in the display. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The electronic component may be a structure that uses light such as a camera, a light sensor, a light-based proximity sensor, a status indicator light, a light-based touch sensor array, or a secondary display that has display pixels that may be viewed through the openings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Signals associated with the electronic component may pass through the openings. The signals may include acoustic signals, electromagnetic signals such as radio-frequency electromagnetic signals, and light. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One or more openings in the display may form a window through which a user of the device may view an external object. Display pixels in the window region may be used in forming a heads-up display.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2017 version of Apple's iPhone is also rumoured to come in red and will retain the same design as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alongside its usual 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch smartphone offerings, the company will also unveil a third model that will be priced at a higher side than iPhone 7 and will sport a 5.1-inch or 5.2-inch OLED display with invisible home button, all-glass housing, wireless charging, according to earlier reports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsung and LG, joined by Foxconn-owned Sharp by 2018, are said to be Apple's primary OLED suppliers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Jan 10 (IANS) India seeks to streamline and enhance efficiency of research funding with the incorporation of best practices across the globe, a veteran scientist said here on Tuesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are trying to get an idea about the (funding) mechanisms elsewhere and wherever possible try to adapt the best practices,&amp;quot; V. Chandrasekhar, a core member of the programme advisory committee of Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was speaking as a group of Indian scientists on Tuesday brainstormed with as many as 14 international scientists and representatives of funding agencies, in a bid to make research funding better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The meeting took place at the SABIC 2017 conference organized by Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SERB under the Union Department of Science and Technology promotes basic research in science and engineering and provides financial assistance to researchers and academic institutions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The recommendations from the meeting would be submitted to the board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the pertinent issues on the radar is the swift delivery of funds and dissemination to the right people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Money is not the issue but how do you make the money come to the aid of the person quickly so it doesn't hamper the work. This is the issue in terms of policy and in terms of how we address ease doing of business. That problem we have even in science,&amp;quot; explained Chandrasekhar, director of NISER, Bhubaneswar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In accordance with India's current thrust on areas such as health, energy and environment, the meeting also addressed the need for identification of topics which could receive special funding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We should reach a stage where we also have equal number of original ideas emanating from India and others elsewhere should be following it. At this stage while the percentage is there, it should be much larger in terms of the country size,&amp;quot; Chandrasekhar added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 10 (IANS) Four Indian-American scientists have been chosen among 102 researchers who will receive the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) -- the highest honour given by the US government to science and engineering professionals.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are: Pankaj Lal from Montclair State University ( Department of Agriculture); Kaushik Chowdhury from Northeastern University (Department of Defense), Manish Arora, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (Department of Health and Human Services) and Aradhna Tripati, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) (National Science Foundation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I congratulate these outstanding scientists and engineers on their impactful work. These innovators are working to help keep the United States on the cutting edge, showing that Federal investments in science lead to advancements that expand our knowledge of the world around us and contribute to our economy,&amp;quot; Obama said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lal, who earned his Master's from Delhi School of Economics, is an associate professor in the department of earth and environmental studies at Montclair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Undertaking interdisciplinary research that explores interconnections among society and the environment, he has been working on environmental economics and economic geography, human dimensions of ecosystem management, natural resource conservation and policy and climate change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chowdhury, who received his PhD from the Georgia Institute of Technology, directs the Next Generation Networks and Systems (GENESYS) Lab. He is the winner of the &amp;quot;NSF CAREER&amp;quot; award in 2015 and the Office of Naval Research Director of Research Early Career Award in 2016. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An environmental epidemiologist and exposure biologist, Arora's research focuses on effects of prenatal and early childhood chemical exposures on life-long health trajectories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He is known for his work on biomarkers that utilise human deciduous and permanent teeth to reconstruct the timing of exposure to various harmful chemicals and essential nutrients. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At UCLA, Tripati's lab uses the chemistry of natural compounds as well as models as tools to understand how the Earth works to understand climate change, the oceans, and the transfer of carbon between the biosphere, atmosphere and oceans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The awards, established by President Bill Clinton in 1996, are coordinated by the Office of Science and Technology Policy within the Executive Office of the US president. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Awardees are selected for their pursuit of innovative research at the frontiers of science and technology and their commitment to community service as demonstrated through scientific leadership, public education or community outreach.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 10 (IANS) Like health care providers deal with smoking or alcoholism cases, internet addiction needs the same approach to help online hookers cut their time on social media, researchers report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To address this, a team of researchers has developed a framework using a theory known as cognitive dissonance which is the discomfort felt by those whose actions conflict with their beliefs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Isaac Vaghefi, Assistant Professor from Binghamton University and Hamed Qahri-Saremi, Assistant Professor at DePaul University, developed a model showing that the degree of users' cognitive dissonance can make a difference in their willingness to quit online addiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Dissonance is what we need to work on and what we need to help increase for users to make sure that they will do some action to limit their control,&amp;quot; said Vaghefi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaghefi tested the model on data collected from 226 students at Binghamton University who said how much they were intending to either stop or continue their usage of social networking sites. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings show that a plausible way to help individuals to reduce or quit usage is to increase their cognitive dissonance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making users aware of their addiction, in particular the consequences on personal, social, and academic lives caused by addiction, increases their cognitive dissonance about their behaviour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;People have already looked at the role of guilt in regard to technology use and how we can change it,&amp;quot; noted Vaghefi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's through cognitive dissonance that a negative emotional state of mind that, once created, can actually have an impact on the actual behaviour and intention of people to stop or discontinue their usage habit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Once people see those negative consequences, they will act on them and will be motivated to exert self-control,&amp;quot; said Vaghefi who presented the paper at the 50th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York/New Delhi, Jan 10 (IANS) Yahoo, which was acquired by US wireless communications service provider Verizon for a mere $4.8 billion in July last year, will soon be called Altaba, media reported on Tuesday, adding that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will step down from the board of directors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Six Yahoo directors will be leaving after the Verizon sale, including Mayer,&amp;quot; The Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the sale of its core internet business, the company will change its name to Altaba Inc., Yahoo said in a regulatory filing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The name is a combination of the words &amp;quot;alternate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Alibaba,&amp;quot; a person familiar with the matter was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The idea behind the name is that Altaba's stock can now be tracked as an alternative to Alibaba because Yahoo owns a sizeable chunk of the Chinese company,&amp;quot; The Washington Post reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Yahoo acquisition will lead Verizon to firm up its operations in the digital ad space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to experts, the viable option for Verizon is now to marry online Yahoo assets with AOL, which it acquired for $4.4 billion. AOL has properties like The Huffington Post and technology websites Techcrunch and Engadget -- and now Yahoo Finance -- which together can become a strong digital advertising platform for Verizon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Verizon will surely monetise both Yahoo and AOL operations to get the best out of this deal,&amp;quot; Vishal Tripathi, Research Director at global market consultancy firm Gartner, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photo-sharing website Flickr and the slowly growing microblogging and social networking website Tumblr are two Yahoo assets that show some promise for growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Verizon has now got Tumblr, Flickr, Yahoo Sports and Yahoo News. With the consolidation, the deal may prove to be a sweet one for Verizon,&amp;quot; Tripathi said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deal means an end to the struggle to survive for Yahoo which was once valued at over $125 billion at its peak in January 2000 when the dot com bubble was nearing its end. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the sale, the company will be left with about $41 billion it invested in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba as well as Yahoo Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verizon makes most of its money from mobile phone connections while Yahoo generated more than twice as much revenue from search and display ads on desktop computers than it did from its so-called MAVENs businesses (Mobile, Video, Native and Social). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 10 (IANS) Fitness trackers and smartphones that record users' daily activities are now likely to be used increasingly in criminal investigations, a new report said, raising questions about individuals' rights that the legal system is not yet fully prepared to address.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Information such as location, travel patterns and even physiological details such as heart rate and activity levels could be retrieved from devices as a part of criminal investigations, said the study from the US-based non-profit RAND Corporation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such technology offers new tools to law enforcement, but raises unique issues regarding important constitutional rights such as self-incrimination, according to the report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;New technologies are developing rapidly and are likely to create conflicts before the legal system is fully prepared to deal with them,&amp;quot; noted Brian Jackson, lead study author and a physical scientist at RAND.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Courtrooms also are poised to change because of technology, with teleconferencing, digital records and even virtual reality entering the scene -- all intended to speed up proceedings and reduce the cost to the justice system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These technologies raise issues of fairness for defendants and may change the notion of whether a trial by video conference is equal to proceedings where everyone appears in person, the report emphasised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both the courts and law enforcement agencies need to make greater efforts to identify the conflicts ahead, as well as educate the criminal justice workforce about how to both properly use and address concerns regarding the emerging tools, it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One example of such a conflict was when investigators probing the mass shooting that took place in San Bernardino in 2015 wanted to unlock a smartphone belonging to one of the shooters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those efforts were delayed while investigators unsuccessfully tried to convince the phone's manufacturer to aid their efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report also recommended better technical training and education for workers across the criminal justice system about how to properly use digital tools. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As medical devices such as cardiac pacemakers become more advanced to include features such as Wi-Fi, it opens the possibility that life-sustaining technology could also be used to collect evidence against a user, according to the report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

They're so small and faint that it's hard to spot them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a possible planet in a nearby stellar system may be betraying its presence in a unique way - by a shadow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A team of astronomers led by John Debes of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland said the shadow is spotted in the stellar system TW Hydrae - located 192 light years away in the constellation Hydra. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The star is roughly 8 million years old and slightly less massive than our Sun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is the very first disk where we have so many images over such a long period of time, therefore allowing us to see this interesting effect,&amp;quot; Debes said. &amp;quot;That gives us hope that this shadow phenomenon may be fairly common in young stellar systems.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The planet itself is not casting the shadow. But it is doing some heavy lifting by gravitationally pulling on material near the star and warping the inner part of the disk. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new study offers a unique way to look for planets hiding in the inner part of the disk and probe what is happening very close to the star, which is not reachable in direct imaging by current telescopes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debes presented the results at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Grapevine, Texas, recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York/New Delhi, Jan 10 (IANS) Yahoo, which was acquired by US wireless communications service provider Verizon for a mere $4.8 billion in July last year, will soon be called Altaba, media reported on Tuesday, adding that Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will step down from the board of directors.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Six Yahoo directors will be leaving after the Verizon sale, including Mayer,&amp;quot; The Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Yahoo acquisition will lead Verizon to firm up its operations in the digital ad space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to experts, the viable option for Verizon is now to marry online Yahoo assets with AOL, which it acquired for $4.4 billion. AOL has properties like The Huffington Post and technology websites Techcrunch and Engadget -- and now Yahoo Finance -- which together can become a strong digital advertising platform for Verizon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Verizon will surely monetise both Yahoo and AOL operations to get the best out of this deal,&amp;quot; Vishal Tripathi, Research Director at global market consultancy firm Gartner, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photo-sharing website Flickr and the slowly growing microblogging and social networking website Tumblr are two Yahoo assets that show some promise for growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Verizon has now got Tumblr, Flickr, Yahoo Sports and Yahoo News. With the consolidation, the deal may prove to be a sweet one for Verizon,&amp;quot; Tripathi said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The deal means an end to the struggle to survive for Yahoo which was once valued at over $125 billion at its peak in January 2000 when the dot com bubble was nearing its end. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the sale, the company will be left with about $41 billion it invested in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba as well as Yahoo Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verizon makes most of its money from mobile phone connections while Yahoo generated more than twice as much revenue from search and display ads on desktop computers than it did from its so-called MAVENs businesses (Mobile, Video, Native and Social). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Visakhapatnam, Jan 9 (IANS) A pilot project using cloud technology by Microsoft and ICRISAT in Andhra Pradesh has increased the groundnut crop yield, it was announced at the 20th National Conference on e-Governance here on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched in June last year, the pilot, based on Intelligent Cloud, involves a new sowing application for farmers combined with a personalised village advisory dashboard and results show a 30 percent higher average in yield per hectare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sowing app was developed to help farmers achieve optimal harvests by advising on the best time to sow depending on weather conditions, soil and other indicators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pilot under a partnership between the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), Microsoft, and Andhra Pradesh government was implemented in Devanakonda in Kurnool district and the advisory applied only to the groundnut crop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ICRISAT adopted Microsoft Cortana Intelligence Suite including Machine Learning (ability of computers to learn without being specifically programmed) and Power BI or Business Intelligence, to empower farmers and government officials with technology, and promote digital farming practices in the state, said a Microsoft official.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Personalised Village Advisory Dashboard has been especially developed to enable officials to better manage programs of scale. Using powerful BI tools, this dashboard provides important insights around soil health, fertiliser recommendations, and seven-day weather forecasts derived from the world's best available weather observations systems and global forecast models.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This data is then downscaled for the highest possible accuracy at the village level, to transform how small holder farmers tackle climate change to drive effective decision-making for their crops.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This result is proof of the efficiencies that cloud technology can bring and thereby help farmers economically by improving agricultural productivity,&amp;quot; said Anil Bhansali, Managing Director, Microsoft India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The applicability of the Intelligent Cloud is a significant start for digital agriculture and we hope more governments and stakeholders come forward to reap benefits of this innovation,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ms/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Jan 9 (IANS) Minister of State for Defence Subhash Bhamre will launch Khanderi, the second of the Kalvari Class submarines, at the Mazagaon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd (MDL) here on Thursday, an official said here..&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch would see the separation of the submarine from the pontoon on which it is being assembled and to its final setting afloat, as the country enters the golden jubilee year of Indian Navy's submarine arm this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first submarine of the Kalvari Class - built by MDL in collaboration with France's DCNS as part of Project 75 - is currently completing its sea trials and is due to be commissioned into the Indian Navy soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The state-of-the-art feature of the Scorpene include superior stealth and ability to launch a crippling attack on the enemy using precision guided weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attacks can be carried out with torpedoes, tube-launched anti-ship missiles both while underwater or on surface in all theatres including the tropics, giving it invulnerability unmatched by many other submarines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can undertake multifarious missions like anti-surface and anti-submarine warfares, intelligence gathering, mine-laying, area surveillance, etc, that are typically undertaken by any modern submarine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Khanderi has been built on the &amp;quot;modular construction&amp;quot; technique, which divided it into several sections and outfitting them concurrently, a complex task involving laying kms of cabling and piping in extremely congested compartments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the equipment have been installed in the submarine with 95 percent cabling and piping completed while processes like pressure testing, setting-to-work and commissioner of various systems are currently underway and continue after it is launched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important safety milestone of &amp;quot;vacuum testing&amp;quot; was completed in the very first attempt on a single day, January 5 (last Thursday), matching the record of Kalvari which also completed it in one shot - a feat unmatched in submarine construction history.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Till December, the submarine will undergo rigorous tests and trials in harbor and at sea, on surface and underwater, testing each system to its fullest capacity, before she would be commissioned into the Indian Navy as &amp;quot;INS Khanderi&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to that, the Kalvari is scheduled to be commissioned and the remaining four Scorpene submarines shall follow suit every nine months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incidentally, as per Indian Navy traditions, ships and submarines are brought &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; again after decommissioning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accordingly, the first ship &amp;quot;Khanderi&amp;quot; was commissioned on December 6, 1968 and decommissioned in October 1989, before being &amp;quot;reincarnated&amp;quot; by MDL as a powerful predator of the deep waters, guarding the vast maritime interests and territories of India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch of Khanderi also marks a generational shift in technology for submarine construction in India and operations by the Indian Navy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MDL has witnessed a huge modernization of the submarine construction facilities, a world-class Composite Naval Submarine Crew Training facility, a 2000-ton hydraulic press, a 100-bar High Press Test facility, a new Kanhoji Angre Wet Basin, a new Module Shop with a retractable roof, a towering 300-ton Goliath crane to assemble warships, and others would enhance the MDL's ability to build quality submarines on time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MDL's jewel in the crown is the new submarine assembly shop spread over 10,000 sqm which can enable it take up concurrent construction of two submarine production lines, adding upto 12 submarines under various stages of construction at any point of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qn/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 9 (IANS) What if you can remotely charge your smartphone with the flat-screen TV in your living room? If we believe a team of US engineers, turning your living room into a wireless charging station is not a far-fetched dream.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flat-screen technology can produce a wide-range, wireless power transfer devices, say engineers from Duke University and University of Washington, adding that the technology already exists to build such a system and it is only a matter of time to design it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Whether its headphones, cell phones, watches or even your mouse and keyboard, a major irritation for consumers is the hassle of being tethered to cords to recharge batteries,&amp;quot; said David Smith, professor at Duke. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They always run dry at the worst possible moment. Our proposed system would be able to automatically and continuously charge any device anywhere within a room, making dead batteries a thing of the past,&amp;quot; Smith wrote in a paper posted on the arXiv pre-print e-repository. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some wireless charging systems already exist to help power speakers, cell phones and tablets. The problem to date has been that the antennas in a wireless power transfer system would need to be able to focus on any device within a room. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solution proposed by Smith and his colleagues relies on metamaterials -- a synthetic material composed of many individual, engineered cells that together produce properties not found in nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine you have an electromagnetic wave front moving through a flat surface made of thousands of tiny electrical cells,&amp;quot; said Smith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If you can tune each cell to manipulate the wave in a specific way, you can dictate exactly what the field looks like when it comes out on the other side,&amp;quot; he explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the results, a flat metamaterial device no bigger than a typical flat-screen television could focus beams of microwave energy down to a spot about the size of a cell phone within a distance of up to 10 metres. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should also be capable of powering more than one device at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The ability to safely direct focused beams of microwave energy to charge specific devices, while avoiding unwanted exposure to people, pets and other objects, is a game-changer for wireless power,&amp;quot; said co-author Matt Reynolds from the University of Washington. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smith has used this principle to create the world's first cloaking device that bends electromagnetic waves around an object held within.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve this on a big scale, a powerful, low-cost electromagnetic energy source would need to be developed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I think building a system like this, which could be embedded in the ceiling and wirelessly charge everything in a room, is a very feasible scheme,&amp;quot; Smith noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Jan 9 (IANS) The second of the Scorpene class submarines, INS Khanderi, will be launched here on January 12, officials said on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The state-of-art features of the Scorpene submarines include superior stealth and the ability to launch a crippling attack on the enemy using precision guided weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attack can be launched with torpedoes as well as tube launched anti-ship missiles whilst underwater or on surface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stealth features will give it an invulnerability unmatched by many submarines, officials said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Scorpene submarine is designed to operate in all theatres including the tropics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All means and communications are provided to ensure inter-operability with other components of a Naval Task Force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It can undertake multifarious types of missions, including anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, intelligence gathering, mine laying and area surveillance, which are typically undertaken by any modern submarine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Built according to the principle of Modular Construction at the Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Ltd, the construction of the submarine involves dividing it into a number of sections and outfitting them concurrently, said officials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The equipment is mounted in a special manner and then embarked into the sections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The complexity of the task increases exponentially as it involves laying kilometres of cabling and piping in extremely congested compartments. Further, the stringent tolerances of the Scorpene required to be maintained were indeed a challenge, but were successfully achieved by MDL with traditional skill, determination and tenacity,&amp;quot; an official said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All equipment has been installed in the submarine with 95 per cent cabling and piping also being completed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pressure testing, setting-to-work and commissioning of various systems of the submarine is presently in progress and would continue after the launching of the submarine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;All-important safety milestone of vacuum testing was completed in the first attempt itself, and within a single day on January 5 this year. This matched the record of Kalvari, the first Scorpene class submarine, which also completed the Vacuum Test in one shot, a feat unmatched in the annals of submarine construction,&amp;quot; an official said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From its launch to December 2017, the submarine will undergo rigorous trials and tests both in harbour and at sea, on surface and under water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These trials are designed to test each system to its fullest capacity. Thereafter she would be commissioned into the Indian Navy as INS Khanderi. This would be preceded by the commissioning of Kalvari later this year. The other four submarines will follow in the wake of Khanderi at intervals of nine months,&amp;quot; the official said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boat is named after the first Khanderi, a diesel-electric submarine which was commissioned into the Indian Navy in 1968, and decommissioned in 1989.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2005, India purchased six Scorpene submarines for $3 billion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These submarines are being manufactured under a technology transfer agreement by the state-owned Mazagon Docks in Mumbai in collaboration with French group DCNS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The submarines were initially to be delivered between 2012 and 2016, however the project is running almost four years behind schedule and the first of the six Scorpene submarines, INS Kalvari, is currently undergoing sea trials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ao/py/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 9 (IANS) Most of the people believe they are smarter than those behind email phishing scams which is why so many fall easily into a trap and lose money, an Indian-origin researcher has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to H.R. Rao from University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), overconfident e-mail recipients are helping phishing succeed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A big advantage for phishers is self efficacy. Many times, people think they know more than they actually do and are smarter than someone trying to pull of a scam via an e-mail,&amp;quot; said Rao who is AT&amp;T Distinguished Chair in Infrastructure Assurance and Security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, phishing e-mails often look like messages from companies ordinary people recognise and trust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They're getting very good at mimicking the logos of popular companies,&amp;quot; Rao noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his study, Rao utilised an experimental survey that had subjects choose between the genuine and the sinister e-mails that he and his colleagues had created for the project. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterward, the subjects explained why they made their choices, which allowed Rao to classify which type of overconfidence was playing a role in their decision-making processes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Rao, people will continue to be victimised by phishing scams until the public becomes better educated and, subsequently, less overconfident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Thousands of e-mails are sent out every day with the aim of harming someone or gaining access to their financial information. Avoiding that kind of damage is entirely in our own hands,&amp;quot; Rao suggested in a paper that appeared in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 9 (IANS) With the rise of digital natives, better logistics, broadband and internet-ready devices, the number of consumers shopping online is going to cross 100 million this year from 69 million in 2016, a joint study said here on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In 2016, about 69 million consumers purchased online and the number is expected to cross 100 million by 2017 with the rise of digital natives, better infrastructure in terms of logistics, broadband and Internet-ready devices to fuel the demand in e-commerce,&amp;quot; according to an Assocham-Resurgent India study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per the findings of the joint study, Bengaluru has left behind all other cities in India shopping online in the year 2016. While Mumbai ranks second, Delhi ranks third in their preference for online shopping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint study revealed that Indian e-retail looks even more promising which is up from $3.59 billion in 2013 to $5.30 billion in 2014 (an increase of 48 per cent), by the end of 2018, it is expected to touch $17.52 billion (with growth of 65 per cent).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2017, mobile commerce will become more important as most of the companies are shifting to m-commerce. Mobile already accounts for 30-35 per cent of e-commerce sales, and its share will jump to 45-50 per cent by 2017,&amp;quot; added the report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There is a surge in the number of people shopping on mobile across India with tier II and III cities displaying increased dominance. In fact, 50 per cent of our traffic is coming from mobile and a majority of them are first time customers,&amp;quot; the study added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The year 2017 will see large scale growth in the Indian e-commerce sector with increased participation from people across the country. This industry will continue to drive more employment opportunities and contribute towards creating more entrepreneurs through the e-commerce marketplace model, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The joint study said the total retail sales in India will likely increase from the $717.73 billion during 2014 to touch $1,244.58 billion by 2018. The total retail sales is growing at an impressive rate of 15 per cent, registering a double digit growth figure year after year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/ksk/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 9 (IANS) For any domestic phonemaker, it is a challenge to compete with Chinese players offering high-end specifications in the mid-range segment. Where several of these devices pack octa-core/quad-core systems, Indian smartphone maker Hyve Mobility has launched Pryme -- country\'s first smartphone that comes with deca-core processing power.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The MediaTek Helio X20 deca-core processor is the USP of the device which gives it an edge over competitors like Xiaomi Mi Max Prime and LeEco Le Max 2 when it comes to performance during heavy usage. 

Here is what we think of Pryme.

Built in metallic unibody design, Pryme has good looks but some users may find it difficult to use the device with one hand.

Weighing 188 grams, the device feels heavy in hand and might annoy when used for longer hours. The 5.7-inch full-HD display produces very sharp colours and offers good viewing angles. 

The fingerprint sensor works fine and unlocks the device instantly. 

You can also adjust the video and picture quality using the device\'s in-built features like \&amp;quot;Clear Motion\&amp;quot; and \&amp;quot;Miravision\&amp;quot;. 

Clear Motion reduces stutters in videos while with the \&amp;quot;Miravision\&amp;quot; feature, you can optimise the display depending on your preferences. The touchscreen works fine and typing is easy.  

Clubbed with 4GB of RAM, the phone ran smoothly without showing any signs of sluggishness. 

We also played high-end games like Asphalt 8 and, along with running multiple apps in the background, switching between the apps was easy and there was no heating.

Running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow operaing system, Pryme has an easy-to-use user interface. The 200GB of expandable storage gives users more than enough room to store multi-media content.

Once charged, the 3,500mAh battery lasted for a day even after continuous use and connected Wi-Fi.

What does not work?

The 13MP rear camera with dual flash is a big disappointment in low-light conditions. Also, when the photos are zoomed in, lack of detail becomes evident. Given the price, the 8MP front camera is also not very impressive.

The camera app also does not offer modes that could enhance the photo-capturing experience.

Conclusion: At a price of 17,999, Hyve Pryme offers decent performance but fails in camera department. The deca-core processor is one feature that will attract buyers.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 9 (IANS) Private funding raised by internet companies in India fell to a three-year low last quarter (ending December), with less than $300 million being raised, a report released by Jefferies said here on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Private funding raised by internet companies slowed further in the December quarter to the lowest since June 2013 quarter at less than $300 million, continuing with the trend observed for 2016 when funding declined over 50 per cent to $2.7 billion versus $5.8 billion raised in 2015,&amp;quot; the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While e-tailing continued to account for the largest share of fund raising, its share continued to shrink from a peak of 74 per cent of the total funds raised in 2014 to 37 per cent in 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Segments which gained share included travel (Makemytrip, Ibibo, Yatra all raised funding this year), services (Byju), social network (Hike), classifieds (CarTrade) and fin-tech (Mobikwik),&amp;quot; the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding 2017 outlook, Jefferies said increased focus on profitability and consolidation were two key themes that played out in the Indian internet sector over the last 12 months and it expects these to continue in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We expect some down-rounds this year following up to news flow on valuation markdowns last year. Fin-tech companies are likely to see momentum and attract more funding as a positive fall-out of demonetisation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Online/digital content (entertainment, education) would be the other area to look out for this year. With increasing 4G penetration, falling data tariffs and the entry of large players like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Reliance Jio's bouquet of content apps, the enabling infrastructure seems to be falling in place,&amp;quot; the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/sm/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 9 (IANS) Two senior Samsung executives on Monday questioned by investigators as they accelerated the probe into allegations surrounding the influence-peddling scandal that has led to President Park Geun-hye's impeachment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choi Gee-sung, head of Samsung Group's future strategy office, and his deputy Chang Choong-ki appeared in the office of the independent counsel team. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They lead the group's future strategy planning division believed to be the de facto control tower that makes key decisions for Samsung and is closely linked to the ongoing scandal, Yonhap news agency reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsung is suspected of giving financial support to foundations and a company controlled by Geun-hye' friend Choi Soon-sil, who is at the centre of the scandal, in return for a state-run pension fund's backing of a major merger deal between Samsung subsidiaries in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The probe team is investigating whether the presidential office Cheong Wa Dae pressured the state fund to support the merger in return for favours Samsung had given to Park's friend, who is standing trial over a string of corruption charges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The two were called in to bear witness to the case, but their statuses could change to that of suspect in the course of the interrogation,&amp;quot; an official on the investigation team said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The probe team also summoned Choi Soon-sil but she declined to appear, saying she needs to prepare for her own trial slated for Wednesday and President Park's impeachment hearing Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 9 (IANS) Using data from NASA's NuSTAR (Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array), a team of researchers has detected two hidden gas-enshrouded supermassive black holes located at the centres of nearby galaxies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Monster black holes sometimes lurk behind gas and dust, hiding from the gaze of most telescopes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But they give themselves away when material they feed on emits high-energy X-rays that NuSTAR mission recently identified.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These black holes are relatively close to the Milky Way, but they have remained hidden from us until now. They're like monsters hiding under your bed,&amp;quot; said Ady Annuar, graduate student at Durham University in the United Kingdom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both of these black holes are the central engines of what astronomers call &amp;quot;active galactic nuclei&amp;quot; - a class of extremely bright objects that includes quasars and blazars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Just as we can't see the Sun on a cloudy day, we can't directly see how bright these active galactic nuclei really are because of all of the gas and dust surrounding the central engine,&amp;quot; added Peter Boorman from University of Southampton.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boorman led the study of an active galaxy called IC 3639, which is 170 million light years away. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers analyzed NuSTAR data from this object and compared them with previous observations from NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory and the Japan-led Suzaku satellite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings from NuSTAR confirmed the nature of IC 3639 as an active galactic nucleus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More surprising is the spiral galaxy that Annuar focused on: NGC 1448. Annuar's study discovered that this galaxy also has a thick column of gas hiding the central black hole, which could be part of a doughnut-shaped region. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;X-ray emission from NGC 1448, as seen by NuSTAR and Chandra, suggests for the first time that, as with IC 3639, there must be a thick layer of gas and dust hiding the active black hole in this galaxy from our line of sight,&amp;quot; the team noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers also found that NGC 1448 has a large population of young (just five million year old) stars, suggesting that the galaxy produces new stars at the same time that its black hole feeds on gas and dust. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team presented the results at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Grapevine, Texas recently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 9 (IANS) At Macworld 2007 in San Francisco, Steve Jobs introduced the world to iPhone as three products in one -- a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone and a breakthrough internet communications device.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;January 9 marks the tenth anniversary of Apple's iPhone. In the 10 years since, iPhone has enriched the lives of people around the world with over one billion units sold. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It quickly grew into a revolutionary platform for hardware, software and services integration and inspired new products, including iPad and Apple Watch, along with millions of apps that have become essential to people's daily lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;iPhone is an essential part of our customers' lives and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live,&amp;quot; said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, the company introduced iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus that came with A10 Fusion chip, most powerful chip ever in a smartphone, with processing performance 120 times faster and the graphics performance 240 times faster in iPhone 7 than the original iPhone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The smartphone sports a 12MP lens, optical image stabilisation, an f/1.8 aperture that captures 50 per cent more light as well as wide colour capture, all allowing for more vibrant colours with more detail even in low light, while iPhone 7 Plus also offers a dual-lens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iOS 10 was the biggest iOS release ever, with innovations including -- bringing the power of the App Store to Messages, a Memories feature in Photos, SiriKit for developers so apps can talk to Siri, an improved Maps app that is even simpler and more intuitive to use, support for breaking news notifications and paid subscriptions in the News app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;iPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. The best is yet to come,&amp;quot; Cook added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/sana/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Tokyo, Jan 8 (IANS) If you are an infrequent internet user, then mere presence of a smartphone can adversely affect your cognitive performance, a study has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The mere presence of a mobile phone was a distraction among infrequent internet users,&amp;quot; said Jun-ichiro Kawahara, Associate Professor at Hokkaido University, Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also found that people who are often glued to a screen are not easily distracted by the presence of a cell phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In presence of a mobile phone, people are automatically drawn to it and then the individual differences decide how they attempt to ignore it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers measured the effect of mobile phones on the ability to pay attention of 40 undergraduate students divided into two groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers placed a mobile phone next to a computer monitor, asked the participants of one group to search for a target character amongst other characters that appeared on the monitor screen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the another group, a memo pad of the same size as the phone was placed by the monitor, and the same experiment was conducted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The participants were asked about how frequently they use and how attached they are to the internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers found that people who infrequently used the internet took longer to find the target character than the control group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, it was found that heavy users were not distracted by the phone and rather more efficient to notice the target when it appeared on the side of the monitor where the mobile phone was placed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study -- published in the journal Japanese Psychological Research -- also suggests that the influence of a mobile phone on users' cognitive performance differed depending on the degree of their internet usage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Toronto, Jan 8 (IANS) Researchers have developed a special salt treatment that can make common surgical masks capable of trapping and killing airborne viruses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Surgical masks were originally designed to protect the wearer from infectious droplets in clinical settings, but it does not help much to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases such as SARS or MERS or influenza,&amp;quot; said Hyo-Jick Choi, Professor at University of Alberta in Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Airborne pathogens like influenza are transmitted in aerosol droplets when we cough or sneeze. The masks may well trap the virus-laden droplets but the virus is still infectious on the mask. Merely handling the mask opens up new avenues for infection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even respirators designed to protect individuals from viral aerosols have the same shortcoming -- viruses trapped in respirators still pose risks for infection and transmission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, showed the potential of a salt treatment to improve the efficacy of the fibre filter inside the masks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ironically, the inspiration for the new solution came from a problem that the researchers faced while developing oral vaccines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A major hurdle in the development of oral vaccines is that when liquid solutions dry, crystals form and destroy the virus used in vaccines, rendering the treatment useless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, Choi flipped the problem on its head and turned crystallisation into a bug buster, using it as a tool to kill active viruses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choi and his team developed a salt formulation and applied it to the filters, in the hope that salt crystals would &amp;quot;deactivate&amp;quot; the influenza virus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mechanics of simple chemistry make the treatment work, the researchers reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When an aerosol droplet carrying the influenza virus contacts the treated filter, the droplet absorbs salt on the filter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The virus is exposed to continually increasing concentrations of salt. As the droplet evaporates, the virus suffers fatal physical damage when the salt returns to its crystalised state, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 8 (IANS) Symptoms of agitation among patients with dementia can be managed safely by using tablet computers, a new study has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, builds upon previous studies demonstrating that art, music, and other similar therapies can effectively reduce symptoms of dementia without medication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By using tablet devices to employ these therapies, however, patients and providers also benefit from a computer's inherent flexibility, the study noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Tablet use as a nonpharmacologic intervention for agitation in older adults, including those with severe dementia, appears to be feasible, safe, and of potential utility,&amp;quot; said Ipsit Vahia from McLean Hospital, Massachusetts, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We know that art therapy can work, music therapy can work. The tablet, however, gives you the option of switching from one app to another easily, modifying the therapy seamlessly to suit the individual. You do not need to invest in new equipment or infrastructure,&amp;quot; Vahia added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The use of tablet is safe for every patient, regardless of the severity of their dementia, according to the study that noted that the use of tablets significantly reduced symptoms of agitation among patients with milder forms of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Citing an example of a Romanian-speaking patient, Vahia explained, &amp;quot;We started showing him Romanian video clips on YouTube, and his behaviour changed dramatically and instantaneously. His mood improved. He became more interactive. He and his medical support team also started using a translation app so that staff could ask him simple questions in Romanian, facilitating increased interaction.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/ksk/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Toronto, Jan 8 (IANS) The very few people who do not like music at all may have reduced brain connectivity between two regions of the brain linked to sound processing and reward.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings showed that people who lacked joy from music -- a condition described as specific musical anhedonia -- had reduced functional connectivity between cortical brain regions responsible for processing sound and subcortical regions related to reward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The inability to experience pleasure from music affects three-to-five per cent of the world's population, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the team led by researchers at McGill University in Quebec, Canada, recruited 45 healthy participants who listened to musical excerpts inside an fMRI machine while providing pleasure ratings in real-time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To control their brain's response to other reward types, the participants also played a monetary gambling task in which they could win or lose real money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results revealed that while listening to music, people with the specific musical anhedonics did show reduced functional connectivity between cortical regions associated with auditory processing and the activity of the nucleus accumbens -- a key subcortical structure of the reward network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In contrast, individuals with high sensitivity to music showed enhanced connectivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, when the participants won money in the gambling task, their nucleus accumbens showed increased activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that subjects could be insensible to music while still being responsive to another stimulus like money suggests different pathways to reward for different stimuli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This finding may pave the way for the detailed study of the neural substrates underlying other domain-specific anhedonias and, from an evolutionary perspective, help us to understand how music acquired reward value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These findings not only help us to understand individual variability in the way the reward system functions, but also can be applied to the development of therapies for treatment of reward-related disorders, including apathy, depression, and addiction,&amp;quot; said Robert Zatorre, neuroscientist at McGill University, Quebec.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/ksk/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 8 (IANS) If you are looking for a mid-segment smartphone that stays for long as you surf, watch movies or play games, Taiwanese smartphone manufacturer ASUS has brought Zenfone 3 Max that has a 4,100mAh battery and also doubles up as a power bank for charging other devices.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On top of it, the Rs 17,999 device packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 64-bit octa-core processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage.

Here is what works for the device.

Although Zenfone 3 Max has the same design elements as other Zenfone devices, it sports a 2.5D contoured glass touchscreen, comes in a sandblasted full-metal, aluminum alloy body with chamfered edges, giving users a sturdy feel.

Despite packing a 5.5-inch display, the smartphone weighs only 175 grams and is up to 8.5mm thick , making it one of the lightest smartphones with a huge battery.

The fingerprint sensor positioned at the back is also integrated with the camera and can register up to five separate fingerprints.

A double tap opens the \&amp;quot;PixelMaster\&amp;quot; camera app and a single tap captures the photo which comes handy in situations when you do not want to miss a moment by juggling to unlock the device and then open the camera app.

The full-HD display gives 75 per cent screen-to-body ratio and delivers better sharpness. Side-to-side viewing and sunlight readability was also up to the mark. 

From multi-tasking to playing games, Zenfone 3 Max performed much like the Oppo F1s (that costs Rs 17,990) which is its nearest rival.

The 16MP primary camera is fast and produced good amount of detail in pictures, capturing natural colours and skin tones.

If you are a selfie lover, the 20MP front camera of Vivo V5 (priced at Rs 17,980) and 16MP \&amp;quot;selfie\&amp;quot; camera of Oppo F1s performed better, producing sharp faces, well-adjusted colour saturation with proper contrast and brightness, than the Zenfone 3 Max that has 8MP front shooter.

For videos, an electronic image stabilisation (EIS) system in the Zenfone 3 Max counteracts hand movements, ensuring that videos captured are stable and shake-free.

However, Zenfone 3 Max packs a larger battery than Vivo V5 and Oppo F1s.

The high-capacity 4,100mAh battery lasted approximately two full days before shutting down on mixed usage, including social media apps, light gaming and other productivity tools, on a single charge.

Even if you are hooked to screen every now and then, Zenfone 3 Max will easily last for a day. The smartphone also comes with an USB OTG cable that turns the phone into a charger to power up other gadgets.

The smartphone also offers performance, normal, power-saving, super-saving and customised-power modes that enable users to regulate their usage according to their needs. 

What does not work?

The design is plain and not very impressive. Images taken even in day-light conditions appear grainy when zoomed in.

Conclusion: If you want a well-built smartphone that will last longer, then the ASUS Zenfone 3 Max will prove to be good choice.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Lhasa, Jan 7 (IANS) China is working to set up the world's highest altitude gravitational wave telescopes in Tibet Autonomous Region to detect the faintest echoes resonating from the universe, which may reveal more about the Big Bang.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Construction has started for the first telescope, code-named Ngari No.1, 30 km south of Shiquanhe town in Ngari Prefecture, said Yao Yongqiang, chief researcher with the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xinhua news agency reported. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The telescope, located 5,250 meters above sea level, will detect and gather precise data on primordial gravitational waves in the Northern Hemisphere. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is expected to be operational by 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yao said the second phase involves a series of telescopes, code-named Ngari No. 2, to be located about 6,000 meters above sea level. He did not give a time frame for construction of Ngari No. 2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The budget for the two-phase Ngari gravitational wave observatory is an estimated 130 million yuan ($18.8 million). The project was initiated by the Institute of High Energy Physics, National Astronomical Observatories, and Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, among others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ngari, with its high altitude, clear sky, and minimal human activity, is said to be one of the world's best spots to detect tiny twists in cosmic light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yao said the Ngari observatory will be among the world's top primordial gravitational wave observation bases, alongside the South Pole Telescope and the facility in Chile's Atacama Desert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gravitational waves were first proposed by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity 100 years ago, but it wasn't until 2016 that scientists with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory announced proof of the waves' existence, spurring fresh research interest among the world's scientists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China has announced its own gravitational wave research plans, which include the launch of satellites and setting up FAST, a 500-meter aperture spherical radio telescope in southwest China's Guizhou Province.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS &lt;br&gt;gsh/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Moscow, Jan 7 (IANS) Accusing LinkedIn of flouting local laws that require internet firms to store data on citizens within the nations borders, the Russian authorities have asked Apple and Google to remove the professional networking site app from their online stores.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, a Russian court blocked the Microsoft-owned LinkedIn service for breaching the country's data protection rules. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to The New York Times, Apple has confirmed that it was asked to remove its LinkedIn app in Russia about a month ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, Google has not confirmed if it had removed LinkedIn in Russia but said that it adhered to Russian local laws,&amp;quot; the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, LinkedIn responded that the company was &amp;quot;disappointed&amp;quot; with the decision by Russian regulators to block the service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It denies access to our members in Russia and the companies that use LinkedIn to grow their businesses,&amp;quot; Nicole Leverich, a spokeswoman for LinkedIn, was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn has several million users in Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this week, Apple removed the New York Times from its app store following a request from Chinese authorities claiming the app was in violation of regulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China is known for banning digital sites like Facebook and Google that it believes harm its national security or promote misinformation. The Wall Street Journal's Chinese-language site has been blocked since 2014.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 7 (IANS) By measuring the material along NASA&lt;SNG-QTS&gt;s two Voyager spacecraft&lt;SNG-QTS&gt;s future trajectories as they move through space, the Hubble space telescope is providing them the road map, scientists have reported.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, the Voyagers are measuring the interstellar medium, the mysterious environment between stars.

\&amp;quot;Hubble gives context to what each Voyager is passing through,\&amp;quot; said study leader Seth Redfield of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, US. 

NASA launched the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft in 1977. Both explored the outer planets Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 went on to visit Uranus and Neptune.

The pioneering Voyager spacecraft are currently exploring the outermost edge of the sun\'s domain. 

A preliminary analysis of the Hubble observations reveals a rich, complex interstellar ecology, containing multiple clouds of hydrogen laced with other elements, the researchers said.

Even after the Voyagers run out of electrical power and are unable to send back new data, which may happen in about a decade, astronomers said they can use Hubble observations to characterise the environment through which these silent ambassadors will glide.

\&amp;quot;This is a great opportunity to compare data from in situ measurements of the space environment by the Voyager spacecraft and telescopic measurements by Hubble,\&amp;quot; Redfield said.

Hubble data, combined with the Voyagers, have also provided new insights into how our sun travels through interstellar space, according to the study presented at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Grapevine, Texas.

\&amp;quot;The Voyagers are sampling tiny regions as they plow through space at roughly 38,000 miles per hour. But we have no idea if these small areas are typical or rare. The Hubble observations give us a broader view because the telescope is looking along a longer and wider path,\&amp;quot; Redfield noted.

The astronomers hope that the Hubble observations will help them characterise the physical properties of the local interstellar medium. 

\&amp;quot;Ideally, synthesising these insights with in situ measurements from Voyager would provide an unprecedented overview of the local interstellar environment,\&amp;quot; Hubble team member Julia Zachary of Wesleyan University, noted.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 7 (IANS) NASA\'s Hubble Space Telescope has discovered exocomets -- comets outside our solar system -- plunging onto a young star that resides 95 light-years from Earth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This star, called HD 172555, represents the third extrasolar system where astronomers have detected doomed, wayward comets. All of the systems are young, under 40 million years old, NASA said in a statement on Saturday.

The exocomets were not directly seen around the star, but their presence was inferred by detecting gas that is likely the vaporised remnants of their icy nuclei.

Astronomers have found similar plunges in our own solar system. Sun-grazing comets routinely fall into our sun. 

\&amp;quot;Seeing these sun-grazing comets in our solar system and in three extrasolar systems means that this activity may be common in young star systems,\&amp;quot; said study leader Carol Grady  from NASA\'s Goddard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. 

The presence of these doomed comets provides circumstantial evidence for \&amp;quot;gravitational stirring\&amp;quot; by an unseen Jupiter-size planet, where comets deflected by its gravity are catapulted into the star, the scientists said.

These events also provide new insights into the past and present activity of comets in our solar system. 

\&amp;quot;This activity at its peak represents a star\'s active teenage years. Watching these events gives us insight into what probably went on in the early days of our solar system, when comets were pelting the inner solar system bodies, including Earth,\&amp;quot; Grady said.

The scientists even believe that infalling comets could have transported water to Earth and the other inner planets of our solar system.

\&amp;quot;In fact, these star-grazing comets may make life possible, because they carry water and other life-forming elements, such as carbon, to terrestrial planets,\&amp;quot; Grady noted.

The findings were presented at the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Grapevine, Texas.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 7 (IANS) Sparking a fresh controversy, anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks has threatened to make the private details public of millions of people who have \'verified\' Twitter accounts.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;We are thinking of making an online database with all \'verified\' twitter accounts and their family/job/financial/housing relations,\&amp;quot; the WikiLeaks Task Force said in a tweet, which has now been deleted.

The NYDailyNews on Saturday quoted a Twitter account \'WikiLeaks Task Force\' associated with the WikiLeaks as tweeting that its leadership was in talks about launching an online database containing intimate details such as family relationships and finances of all \'verified\' Twitter users.

Soon after deleting the first tweet, the account tweeted again the same proposal, however in a less invasive tone.

\&amp;quot;We are looking for clear discrete (father/shareholding/party membership) variables that can be put into our AI (Artificial Intelligence) software. Other suggestions?\&amp;quot; the account tweeted.

An accounts becomes verified once the identity of the person tweeting is officially confirmed by the micro-blogging site.

\&amp;quot;Posting another person\'s private and confidential information is a violation of the Twitter rules,\&amp;quot; Twitter said in response to the WikiLeaks\' proposal.

Ethan Lawrence, a British actor with a verified account, lashed out at WikiLeaks, saying, \&amp;quot;I think this plan is creepy, I think you are creepy and I hope someone breaks into your house and rearranges your sofa cushions.\&amp;quot;

WikiLeaks is already facing heat over leaking documents stolen from Democratic groups and individuals by Russian hackers.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 7 (IANS) Facebook has hired former NBC and CNN anchor Campbell Brown to lead its news partnership team, media reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the Brown job will not address the issue of fake news spread, as it was earlier speculated.

Ever since the job was opened in December 2016, there was speculation that the news head could advise Facebook about how to behave as a media outlet, and how to negotiate tricky editorial judgments about things like fake news.

According to a report in the New York Times on Friday, Facebook executives emphasised that Brown\'s role was not to act as the sort of editor-in-chief that some commentators  had suggested.

\&amp;quot;This is a different role for me, but one where I will be tapping my newsroom experience to help news organisations and journalists work more closely and more effectively with Facebook. I will be working directly with our partners to help them understand how Facebook can expand the reach of their journalism, and contribute value to their businesses,\&amp;quot; wrote Brown on her Facebook page on Friday.

Facebook has come under sharp criticism from last few months for its alleged role in proliferation of fake news and censorship. Facebook has taken various steps claiming that it would help curb the fake news spread.

Brown is said to work as a liaison with news organisations so that Facebook can better meet their journalistic and business imperatives and build up trust among them. 

\&amp;quot;Facebook executives said they were hiring Brown for her understanding of the news industry as a onetime White House correspondent, co-anchor of \'Weekend Today\' and primary substitute anchor of \'Nightly News\' at NBC News, and prime-time anchor on CNN, which she left in 2010,\&amp;quot; the report said.

According to a report in Fortune on Saturday, there have been reports that the Facebook is planning to finance, acquire or license its own TV-style shows, something that might make a number of companies nervous. 

\&amp;quot;Presumably part of Brown\'s job will be to convince them that Facebook is their friend and partner, even as it competes with them,\&amp;quot; the report noted.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 7 (IANS) Hit by a slump in iPhone sales globally which led to the company missing its revenue and profit goals for 2016, tech giant Apple has cut its CEO Tim Cook's pay for the year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cook received $8.75 million in total compensation for 2016 -- down from $10.28 million in 2015 -- which the company said declined for the first time since he assumed office in 2011. Cook's base salary, however, rose 50 per cent to $3 million.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;According to a regulatory filing on Friday, Apple said its annual sales of $215.6 billion were 3.7 per cent below its target of $223.6 billion, and its operating income of $60 billion was 0.5 per cent short of the $60.3 billion target,&amp;quot; The Wall Street Journal reported. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple's five-most senior executives also saw their total compensation fall for fiscal 2016, each declining around nine per cent to about $22.8 million from $25 million in the prior year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their 2016 compensation included $2.8 million in salary and $20 million in restricted stock, the report noted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, announcing the results for the fourth quarter of 2016, Apple said it sold 45.5 million iPhones, 9.3 million iPads and 4.9 million Macs -- a year-over-year decline of 5.2 per cent for iPhones, six per cent for iPads and a massive 14 per cent for the Mac. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple is now eyeing hopes on iPhone 7 which was launched in September and forthcoming versions, including an expected 10th-anniversary iPhone later this year, that may tilt the figures in favour of Apple in the near future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

This was a period when regions used solar time to set their own clocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solar time worked well enough until trains came along and the need for standardised time arose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following his missed train in 1876, Fleming proposed a worldwide standard time at a meeting of the Royal Canadian Institute on February, 8, 1879. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He advocated for dividing the world into 24 time zones beginning at the Greenwich Meridian and spaced at 15 degree intervals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His proposal gave way to the International Prime Meridian Conference which convened in 1884 and was attended by 25 nations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was here that Fleming's system of international standard time was adopted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fleming was also known for helping build the Intercontinental Railway, serving as chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and designing Canada's first postage stamp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 7 (IANS) The US intelligence has released a report, making public its assessment of alleged Russia\'s interference in the presidential election last year.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election,\&amp;quot; the report said on Friday, Xinhua news agency reported.

The reported adding that Moscow\'s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process.  

\&amp;quot;We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump,\&amp;quot; it said. \&amp;quot;We have high confidence in these judgments.\&amp;quot;

The report said Moscow\'s action was part of its \&amp;quot;longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order\&amp;quot; and demonstrated a \&amp;quot;significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort.\&amp;quot;

The report is the declassified version of a comprehensive intelligence report that US President Barack Obama directed the intelligence community to conduct on December 9, 2016.

Trump has repeatedly refused to accept the findings that Russia has intervened in the 2016 presidential election. He quoted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange this week to voice new doubt about the hacking claim made by US intelligence agencies. 

The Russian government has also denied the accusations.

On Friday, Trump met chiefs of intelligence agencies in New York to be briefed on alleged Russia cyber attacks against the US.

Following the meeting, Trump said the alleged hacking activities had no impact on the election results and he didn\'t directly acknowledge Moscow\'s responsibility.

However, Trump added that he had a \&amp;quot;constructive meeting\&amp;quot; with the top intelligence officials, and he had \&amp;quot;tremendous respect\&amp;quot;  for the work of the intelligence community.

The President-elect also said he will appoint a team within 90 days to figure out ways to stop foreign hacking.

\&amp;quot;Whether it is our government, organizations, associations or businesses we need to aggressively combat and stop cyberattacks,\&amp;quot; he said.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Jan 6 (IANS) Experts from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, have designed a web-enabled application that identifies ecologically sensitive regions (ESR) in the Western Ghats and pinpoints sites that are open to development.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spatial decision support system (SDDS) would aid local administrators and industry players to take a call on biodiversity conservation plans and setting up projects. It will be launched in a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It helps in identifying the important ecologically sensitive areas. We have divided the region (the Western Ghats) into four ESR grades starting with the site which is having highest forest cover and good flora and fauna species (ESR1) and ending with ESR4, which signifies the site that is open for development,&amp;quot; Bharath Setturu of IISs Bengaluru, told IANS here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For any development activity to take place, it has to be in ESR4. If someone wants to set up an industry, they can zero in on the area, find out details on biodiversity and socio-economic aspects and they will be able to ask questions about their developmental plans,&amp;quot; said Setturu, who is party of the Energy and Wetlands Research Group at IISCs' Centre for Ecological Sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Setturu was in the city to attend the International Symposium on Water Urbanism and Infrastructure Development in eco-sensitive Zone organised by Ranbir and Chitra Gupta School of Infrastructure Design and Management (RCGSIDM) at IIT Kharagpur, in association with Columbia University, NYC, USA and IISc Bangalore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The SDSS helps local administrators in decision making and implementing conservation plans towards the sustenance of biodiversity in the ecologically fragile and biodiversity rich ecosystems,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said the system can be applied to the rest of the country and can be customised according to a state or biodiversity hotspot by feeding in data on flora and fauna specific to that area. The current version of the system was done with the involvement of Karnataka Biodiversity Board, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have considered four aspects: biodiversity, socio economic activities, whether the region is having sustainable development or not and whether the development can take place based on the three former factors,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details of the application will be presented at the symposium on Saturday. The publication about the system is co-authored by T.V. Ramachandra and N.M. Tara.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have done it with the support of the Department of Science and Technology and Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change. Implementation of SDSS at local levels would help in realising the vision of Biodiversity Act 2002, based on the knowledge of local biodiversity richness,&amp;quot; Ramachandra added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Take heart, a novel suite of 13 speedy mini interactive-apps may help you de-stress and lower anxiety and depression, suggests a study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The apps -- called IntelliCare -- offer exercises to de-stress, reduce self-criticism and worrying, methods to help your life feel more meaningful, mantras to highlight your strengths, strategies for a good night's sleep and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We designed these apps so they fit easily into people's lives and could be used as simply as apps to find a restaurant or directions,&amp;quot; said lead author David Mohr, Professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Illinois, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the study, 96 participants robustly used the IntelliCare interactive apps as many as four times daily -- or an average of 195 times -- for eight weeks. They spent an average of one minute using each app, with longer times for apps with relaxation videos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The participants reported that they experienced about a 50 per cent decrease in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The short-term study-related reductions are comparable to results expected in clinical practice using psychotherapy or with that seen using antidepressant medication, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Using digital tools for mental health is emerging as an important part of our future. These are designed to help the millions of people who want support but can't get to a therapist's office,&amp;quot; Mohr said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study will be published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/ksk/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York/New Delhi, Jan 6 (IANS) Apple on Friday announced that its app developers earned over $20 billion in 2016 -- up over 40 per cent from 2015 and several of those talented minds are from India -- stating that New Year\'s Day was the highest single day ever for the App Store with nearly $240 million in purchases.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the App Store launched in 2008, developers have earned over $60 billion, creating amazing app experiences for App Store customers across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac, Cupertino-headquartered tech giant announced on Friday. 

\&amp;quot;We want to thank our entire developer community for the many innovative apps they have created, which together with our products, help to truly enrich people\'s lives,\&amp;quot; said Philip Schiller, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Marketing, Apple, in a statement. 

According to an Apple India spokesperson, app developers from India are now creating amazing apps for its platform. \&amp;quot;There are several app developers from India who are now part of the growing innovative community globally,\&amp;quot; the spokesperson told IANS.

Apple last year revealed plans for an iOS app design and development facility in Bengaluru.

Across India, Apple supports over 640,000 iOS app developer jobs and other positions related to the iOS ecosystem.

Apple is also reportedly setting up its first manufacturing smartphone plant in Bengaluru this year.

According to the company, purchases from the App Store topped $3 billion in December globally. 

In the same month, Nintendo\'s Super Mario Run made history with more than 40 million downloads in just four days after its release, and was the most downloaded app globally on Christmas and New Year\'s Day. Super Mario Run is also among last year\'s top 10 most downloaded apps worldwide, with Pokemon Go taking the top spot. 

Available in 155 countries, the App Store offers 2.2 million apps in total, up over 20 per cent from last year.

The App Store\'s top-grossing markets include the US, China, Japan and Britain, with China experiencing record year-over-year growth at an incredible 90 per cent. 

iPhone and iPad customers grew the App Store\'s subscription billings significantly in 2016 to $2.7 billion, up 74 per cent from 2015, the company said. 

With the introduction of iMessage apps and SiriKit in iOS 10, developers created exciting new types of app experiences. 

iPhone and iPad customers now have access to over 21,000 iMessage apps to send stickers and easily collaborate with friends, and for the first time ever, users can ask Siri to book rides, make payments, return a call and more.

<description><![CDATA[ Washington, Jan 6 (IANS) NASA said its Chandra X-ray Observatory has obtained an image that gives astronomers the best look yet at the growth of black holes over billions of years beginning soon after the Big Bang.]]></description>
<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 6 (IANS) NASA said its Chandra X-ray Observatory has obtained an image that gives astronomers the best look yet at the growth of black holes over billions of years beginning soon after the Big Bang.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the deepest X-ray image ever obtained, collected with about eleven and a half weeks of Chandra observing time, the US space agency said in a statement.

The image comes from what is known as the Chandra Deep Field-South. The central region of the image contains the highest concentration of supermassive black holes ever seen.

\&amp;quot;With this one amazing picture, we can explore the earliest days of black holes in the universe and see how they change over billions of years,\&amp;quot; said Pennsylvania State University\'s Niel Brandt, who led a team of astronomers studying the deep image.

About 70 per cent of the objects in the new image are supermassive black holes, which may range in mass from about 100,000 to 10 billion times the mass of the Sun. 

Gas falling towards these black holes becomes much hotter as it approaches the event horizon, or point of no return, producing bright X-ray emission.

\&amp;quot;It can be very difficult to detect black holes in the early Universe because they are so far away and they only produce radiation if they\'re actively pulling in matter,\&amp;quot; team member Bin Luo of Nanjing University in China noted. 

\&amp;quot;But by staring long enough with Chandra, we can find and study large numbers of growing black holes, some of which appear not long after the Big Bang,\&amp;quot; Luo added.

The new ultra-deep X-ray image allows scientists to explore ideas about how supermassive black holes grew about one to two billion years after the Big Bang. 

Using these data, the researchers showed that these black holes in the early universe grow mostly in bursts, rather than via the slow accumulation of matter.

The scientists also found hints that the seeds for supermassive black holes may be \&amp;quot;heavy\&amp;quot; with masses about 10,000 to 100,000 times that of the Sun, rather than light seeds with about 100 times the Sun\'s mass. 

This addresses an important mystery in astrophysics about how these objects can grow so quickly to reach masses of about a billion times the Sun in the early universe.

For the study, the team combined the Chandra X-ray data with very deep Hubble Space Telescope data over the same patch of sky. 

These results were presented at the 229th meeting of the American Astronomical Society meeting in Grapevine, Texas.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 6 (IANS) Humans likely established permanent settlements on the high-altitude Tibetan plateau at least 7,400 years ago, much before the advent of agriculture 5,200 years ago, says a study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings are based on an extensive analysis of human handprints and footprints found in 1998 in fossilised hot spring mud near the village of Chusang on Tibet's central plateau, at an elevation of 14,000 feet above sea level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analysis of the archaeological site indicated that the prints were made by people at least 7,400 years ago, and possibly as early as 13,000 years ago. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings, published in the journal Science, challenge the previously held view that permanent human occupation of the Tibetan Plateau began no earlier than development of an agricultural economy between 5,200-3,600 years ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Although an agropastoral lifeway may have enabled substantial population growth after 5,000 years, it by no means was required for the early, likely permanent, occupation of the high central valleys of the Tibetan Plateau,&amp;quot; the researchers wrote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research sheds new light on human colonisation of high-elevation environments, said one of the researchers, Randy Haas from University of Wyoming in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, researchers have been puzzled by the striking differences in how Tibetans and Andean highlanders adapted physiologically to the rigors of life at high elevations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;High-elevation environments were some of the last places in the world that humans colonised, and so they offer something of a natural laboratory for studying human adaptation,&amp;quot; Haas said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sac&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 6 (IANS) By combining data from several telescopes around the world including India\'s Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in Pune, astronomers have discovered a cosmic double whammy unlike any ever seen before.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two of the most powerful phenomena in the Universe, a supermassive black hole, and the collision of giant galaxy clusters, have combined to create a stupendous cosmic particle accelerator, the researchers reported in the journal Nature Astronomy.

\&amp;quot;We have seen each of these spectacular phenomena separately in many places,\&amp;quot; said lead researcher Reinout van Weeren of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US.

\&amp;quot;This is the first time, however, that we seen them clearly linked together in the same system,\&amp;quot;  Weeren noted.

This cosmic double whammy is found in a pair of colliding galaxy clusters called Abell 3411 and Abell 3412 located about two billion light years from Earth. 

The two clusters are both very massive, each weighing about a quadrillion or a billion times the mass of the Sun.

This discovery solves a long-standing mystery in galaxy cluster research about the origin of beautiful swirls of radio emission stretching for millions of light years, detected in Abell 3411 and Abell 3412 with the GMRT.

The team determined that as the shock waves travel across the cluster for hundreds of millions of years, the doubly accelerated particles produce giant swirls of radio emission.

\&amp;quot;This result shows that a remarkable combination of powerful events generate these particle acceleration factories, which are the largest and most powerful in the Universe,\&amp;quot; co-author William Dawson of Lawrence Livermore National Lab in Livermore, California, said. 

Besides GMRT, the researchers combined data from NASA\'s Chandra X-ray Observatory, the US National Science Foundation\'s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, and other telescopes to find out what happens when matter ejected by a giant black hole is swept up in the merger of two enormous galaxy clusters.

\&amp;quot;It is a bit poetic that it took a combination of the world\'s biggest observatories to understand this,\&amp;quot; Dawson noted.

\&amp;quot;It\'s almost like launching a rocket into low-Earth orbit and then getting shot out of the Solar System by a second rocket blast,\&amp;quot; co-author Felipe Andrade-Santos, also of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics.

 \&amp;quot;These particles are among the most energetic particles observed in the Universe, thanks to the double injection of energy,\&amp;quot; Andrade-Santos explained.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 6 (IANS) The US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said Russia staged cyber attacks to try to interfere in the November 8 presidential election.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A report containing declassified information on the Russian hacking operation would be released next week, Clapper said during an appearance before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday, Efe news reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We stand more resolutely on that statement than we did on the seventh of October,&amp;quot; he said, referring to the intelligence community's earlier assertion that Russia was behind the disclosure by WikiLeaks of e-mails from the Democratic National Committee and from the chairman of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, John Podesta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The content of those e-mails caused some embarrassment to the DNC and to Clinton, who ended up losing the November 8 election to Republican Donald Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The forthcoming report would &amp;quot;ascribe a motivation&amp;quot; to Russian President Vladimir Putin for the ostensible interference in the US election, Clapper said, while declining to offer an opinion on whether the activities had any impact on the outcome of the contest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clapper, who would step down when the Obama administration leaves office on January 20, had to apologise to Congress in 2013 after statements he made under oath to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence turned out to be false.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Russia is a full-scope cyber actor that poses a major threat to US government, military, diplomatic, commercial and critical infrastructure,&amp;quot; according to a joint statement submitted to the committee by Clapper, Marcel Lettre, the under secretary of defense for intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, director of the National Security Agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to a question from the committee, Clapper described the ostensible Russian interference as &amp;quot;multifaceted&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The hacking was only one part of it. And it also entailed classical propaganda, disinformation, fake news,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Barack Obama, who last week imposed economic sanctions on several Russian intelligence agencies and private firms and expelled 35 Russian diplomats in reprisal for the alleged electoral interference, is to receive the classified report on the issue later Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump, who has voiced skepticism over the accusations against Moscow, is scheduled to be briefed on the matter Friday by Clapper and the heads of the CIA and FBI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pgh/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kharagpur (West Bengal), Jan 5 (IANS) In a candid chat with students at his alma mater IIT-Kharagpur on Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai recalled his days at the institute, his love life and also his interview with the internet giant even as he urged them to take risks and experiment with different things in life.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pichai doled out unconventional advice to the students on Thursday when he visited the campus after 23 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his addressing at the packed open air theatre, he told them to pursue their passions, take risks, and be creative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Academics is important but it is not as important as it's made out to be. There is a lot of pressure to follow a set of rules throughout your career (in India). When you are in high school you think of college. I get very surprised that people get into the IITs and immediately they are thinking about IIMs and so on. It is so important to get real world experience and be well-rounded,&amp;quot; he said, adding that entry to elite institutions is &amp;quot;important but that doesnt guarantee success. What matters most is loving what you do&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Egged on by the students, Pichai revealed his other side: like any other student he too bunked classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Of course, (I used to bunk morning classes). I think it is the rites of passage when in college. I have to say I worked hard but we did have our share of fun as well,&amp;quot; he said to loud cheers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pichai, who met his wife Anjali at the IIT campus, also highlighted how difficult it was to communicate with girls at their separate hostel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You had to walk in the front and request someone to call them. And they'd go in and loudly say - Anjali, Sundar is here. It wasn't exactly a pleasant experience,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pichai, who joined Google in 2004, said he was interviewed on April Fool's day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quizzed on Gmail at the interview, which had just been introduced by the company, Pichai initially thought it was a prank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So, I remember doing my interviews during the day and people kept asking me what do you think of Gmail, but I didn't have a chance to use it and I thought it was a April Fool's joke.My first three interviews, I couldn't answer well because I hadn't used the product. In my fourth interview when someone asked me have you seen Gmail and I said no, he actually showed me the product. And then the fifth interviewer asked what do you think of Gmail and I was able to answer then,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I still joke sometimes that I got a job because Larry Page didn't interview me,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did Pichai get ragged in college?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It was pretty mellow. I definitely remember when I started (hopefully it has got better by now) we had something called a CG chain which stands for 'centre of gravity chain'. As a freshman, you lock your room and go out, then you come back and the room doors aren't open but everything inside your room has been rearranged. They do it by putting sticks...and all your clothes and rearrange even the furniture. So its quite a shock when you open your room door and walk back in to see your entire room has been rearranged,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His anecdote on how he thought &amp;quot;Abbey saale&amp;quot; was the usual way to address people, elicited the loudest response from the students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I came from Chennai. I learnt Hindi in school but never spoke it much. Just listening to how people were speaking, I just thought you address people this way. One day there was someone in the mess and I had to call him. I called him 'Abey saale!' In my first couple of weeks, I thought you call people that way,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pichai connected with the students on the issue of mess food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We were made to guess whether what was served was dal or sambhar,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked about his GPA, the Google CEO admitted he was too embarrassed to admit his first year's results, but that he did much better in the last three years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pichai also revealed that Infosys founder Narayana Murthy was his ideal during his college days. &amp;quot;I admire people like that who put India on the map,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked by a student as to what she'd have to do to replace him, Pichai said: &amp;quot;I would say be careful what you wish for, but would be happy to discuss over a cup of chai.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On whether the Google doodle could be dedicated to IIT-Kharagpur, Pichai said he will send a mail to the team but &amp;quot;chances are less&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pichai also batted for reducing the cost of entry-level smartphones to $30 and expressed confidence that big, global software companies will start emerging from India in the next five to ten years. He said his organisation is &amp;quot;betting big&amp;quot; on advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning in the coming years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 5 (IANS) The Over-The-Top (OTT) market in India is yet to reach its true potential and low-cost unlimited internet plans along with an ever-increasing smartphone use will help OTT players tap the masses, a new report said on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, in urban India six per cent and 24 per cent population  accesses Over-The-Top (OTT) on a daily and weekly basis, respectively, revealed the report titled 'Now Streaming: OTT' by research and data analytics company Chrome DM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 50 per cent of the viewers still prefer TV as the first screen, it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The entire internet base which is 464 million today qualifies for OTT's growth potential. However, infrastructure enhancement and low-cost unlimited internet plans are the key drivers that will exponentially help in reaching and further increasing the potential base itself,&amp;quot; said Pankaj Krishna, founder and CEO, Chrome DM.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the report, the potential of 'offline' mode in India is quite high because of infrastructural issues and high cost of unlimited internet and the potential of �offline' mode varies with gender, age group and geography of the consumer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also found that more than 75 per cent of the audience prefers free services with ads as they already pay for Internet services while the rest of the population pays for the services with subscription amount varying on the basis of gender, age group and geography.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The OTT players should focus on regional content as inclination towards regional content is increasing, the report suggested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Jan 5 (IANS) Finding it hard to stick to New Year's resolution to quit smoking? Take a heart, a new app-based game may help you achieve that.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game -- Cigbreak Free -- works like a regular smartphone game, with players having to complete tasks to progress through levels and gain rewards. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the game, players have to swipe a certain number of cigarettes to break them within a time limit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it also incorporates a combination of 37 behavioural change techniques, including showing the player the health consequences of a behaviour, gaining points for grabbing healthy items, or providing virtual financial incentives, to help individuals quit smoking, the researchers said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We're essentially trying to 'gamify' health messages and behaviour change techniques as a way of embedding them in a person's mind, in the hope that they will then be able to quit smoking,&amp;quot; said Robert Walton, Professor at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The good thing about a smartphone gaming app is that you can play it anywhere. Craving is a short-term thing, so if you get a craving at 11am, you can play the game in the warm until it passes, rather than going out into the cold for a cigarette. You've also got something to do with your hands other than smoke,&amp;quot; added Hope Caton lecturer at Kingston University. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rewards in the game are a way of giving smokers instant positive feedback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When you're trying to quit smoking you don't get much instant feedback except desire. Your health is better but somehow it doesn't have the same effect as being told you're winning or getting a gold star,&amp;quot; Caton explained, in the study published in the journal BMJ.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/sana/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 5 (IANS) Using a model similar to what meteorologists use to forecast weather and a computer simulation of the physics of evaporating ices, scientists have found evidence of snow and ice features, known as &amp;quot;penitentes&amp;quot;, on Pluto. Until now, these had only been seen on the Earth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Penitentes are snow and ice features formed by erosion that, on the Earth, are characterised by bowl-shaped depressions with blade-like spires around the edge that rise up to several metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until now no penitentes have been identified conclusively on planetary bodies other than the Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new research, published in the journal Nature, indicates that these icy features may also exist on other planets where environmental conditions are similar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This test of our terrestrial models for penitentes suggests that we may find these features elsewhere in the solar system, and in other solar systems, where the conditions are right,&amp;quot; said lead researcher John Moores of York University, Toronto, Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Pluto's environment is very different from the Earth's -- it is much colder, the air much thinner, the sun much dimmer and the snow and ice on the surface are made from methane and nitrogen instead of water -- the same laws of nature apply, Moores said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The identification of these ridges in Pluto's informally named Tartarus Dorsa area suggests that the presence of an atmosphere is necessary for the formation of penitentes, which would explain why they have not previously been seen on other airless icy satellites or dwarf planets, Moores said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research team compared its model to ridges on Pluto imaged by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft in 2015. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pluto's ridges are much larger -- about 500 metres tall and separated by about three to five kilometres -- than their earthly counterparts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This gargantuan size is predicted by the same theory that explains the formation of these features on the Earth,&amp;quot; Moores said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In fact, we were able to match the size and separation, the direction of the ridges, as well as their age: three pieces of evidence that support our identification of these ridges as penitentes,&amp;quot; Moores noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research was done in collaboration with scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Connectivity is extremely important,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Referring to the start-up scenario, the Google CEO said Indian companies should aim higher and compete with MNCs, as the Indian market is not large enough to invest in technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Part of the problem is that in India, the potential is there and market is developing. It will take a few more years for it to realise it's potential. Digital market is still developing. It's a problem we run into. It's just a moment in time,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Hopefully, Indian companies are also more thoughtful so that when they produce something, they ensure that their target is areas such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. Those markets are developed. They need to set their sights a bit bigger. The trend lines are strongly in favour,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the next big thing at Google, Pichai said his organisation is &amp;quot;betting big&amp;quot; on advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in the coming years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I can't quite tell exactly what, but we are betting big on advances in AI and machine learning. Advances in machine learning will bring a difference in many fields.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/nir/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 5 (IANS) Even as satisfaction levels of the subscribers of 4G services in India have risen to 97 per cent in three months, more tariff cuts are on the anvil with retention level for Jio seen at a high 65 percent when its free offer draws to a close, says a survey.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on September 2016 and again three months later, the survey finds 96 per cent of the customers satisfied on voice quality and 66 percent on data speeds. But high cost and slow speeds remain the biggest issues for incumbents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our survey indicates that Jio's free service is gaining reasonable traction with 26 per cent using Jio as primary SIM and 21 per cent as secondary SIM. Some 55 per cent of the surveyed users find Jio speed higher than that of other telcos,&amp;quot; it says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Some 67 per cent said they will use Jio as secondary SIM/dongle and 18 per cent will use as primary one when Jio's free offer ends. Amongst these, 57 per cent said that they will go for Jio's Rs 400-500 package, rather than the cheapest one.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the flip side, it says: &amp;quot;Voice calling is still an issue with only 22 per cent having no problems at all. Some 32 per cent users indicated that they use Jio as it is faster and 28 per cent as it is cheap.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On tariffs and other issues, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has the following points to make:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- While customer satisfaction is high for incumbents, 28 per cent users still find their services expensive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- In our view, only Bharti is trying to create a perception through marketing gimmicks/new packages that its tariffs are at par/cheaper than Jio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- In our view, other telcos will follow-up leading to higher competitive intensity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- We find Bharti Infratel well placed to benefit if telcos spend more on improving their coverage with most consumers using Jio as it is faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- We find smaller telcos like Reliance Comm the most vulnerable as majority of the users with them are secondary SIM consumers and may likely to shift to Jio as their secondary SIM. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it commissioned Survey Monkey to conduct the online survey of 1,000-plus respondents across the country with 500-plus Jio users. The sample had a 47-53 female-male mix, with 78 per cet of the respondents below the age of 44.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ap/ag/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<description><![CDATA[ Las Vegas, Jan 5 (IANS) Aiming to make smart home experiences more accessible, Chinese tech giant Lenovo on Thursday unveiled a Smart Assistant with Amazons Artificial Intelligence (AI) device Alexa at the ongoing 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2017) here.]]></description>
<content><![CDATA[ <p>Las Vegas, Jan 5 (IANS) Aiming to make smart home experiences more accessible, Chinese tech giant Lenovo on Thursday unveiled a Smart Assistant with Amazons Artificial Intelligence (AI) device Alexa at the ongoing 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2017) here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from the assistant, Lenovo also launched Smart Storage, Lenovo 500 Multimedia Controller and Lenovo Phab 2 Pro smartphone apps for a better Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) experiences.

\&amp;quot;After conducting a series of studies on consumers\' pain points and needs, the company designed the Lenovo Smart Assistant -- a new digital personal assistant with Amazon Alexa cloud-based voice services\&amp;quot; Dilip Bhatia, Vice President of Global Marketing, User and Customer Experience Lenovo PC and Smart Device Business Group, told IANS.

Built in collaboration with Amazon, the Lenovo Smart Assistant recognises users\' voice commands to conduct web searches, play music, calendar reminders, among many other functions.

\&amp;quot;We collaborated with Amazon because Alexa is pretty good and people are comfortable with it. Other reason was the price point. Other devices are available for a much higher price but we kept it low to make technology available to the masses,\&amp;quot; Bhatia noted.

The assistant is also designed to run Lenovo smart home devices as well as scores of existing third-party products to expand user options.

\&amp;quot;We are also launching the Harman Kardon Edition at a higher price point that has better speakers with Alexa technology,\&amp;quot; Bhatia noted.

The company also unveiled Lenovo Smart Storage -- a secure digital storage solution with 6TB capacity, dual-band wireless access and multi-device auto-sync capabilities.

Designed for security and P2P (peer-to-peer) access to stored media like photos, music and documents, Smart Storage offers users quick control of data and files. 

The Chinese giant also launched Lenovo 500 Multimedia Controller -- a wireless keyboard and mouse that fits in the palm.

The device improves the way people connect to PCs and web and re-defines how a compact, Human Interface Device (HID) should look, feel and function.

The keyboard area doubles as a Windows 10 gesture-supported, multi-touch capacitive touchpad -- meaning that users can type like a normal keypad with their thumbs or glide their fingers across the surface like a touchpad.

Lenovo also expanded its phablet segment with world\'s first Tango-enabled smartphone -- Lenovo Phab 2 Pro.

The device, which is now available online and on offline platforms, unlocks mobile AR experiences for smartphone users, offering the optimal Tango experience for new apps.

To enable Tango, the device is equipped with a set of sensors that capture 250,000 measurements a second, processing information through motion tracking, area learning and depth sensing.

Lenovo Smart Assistant, which starts at $129.99, will be available in light gray, green and orange colours in May. The Lenovo Smart Assistant Harman Kardon Edition starts at $179.99.

Lenovo Smart Storage starts at $139.99 and will be available in May while Lenovo 500 Multimedia Controller price range starts from $54.99 and will be available in March.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 5 (IANS) In a first, astronomers, including one of Indian-origin, have traced the source of a mysterious radio signal to a dwarf galaxy more than three billion light years from Earth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &amp;quot;sporadically repeating milliseconds-long signal&amp;quot; is one of the rare and brief bursts of cosmic radio waves that have puzzled astronomers since they were first detected nearly a decade ago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new information rules out several suggested explanations for the source of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) including one that suggested the signal could be coming from within or near our own Milky Way galaxy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We now know that this particular burst comes from a dwarf galaxy more than three billion light-years from Earth,&amp;quot; said lead author Shami Chatterjee of Cornell University. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;That simple fact is a huge advance in our understanding of these events,&amp;quot; Chatterjee, an alumnus of Indian Institute of Technology -Madras, added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast Radio Bursts are highly-energetic, but very short-lived (millisecond) whose origins have remained a mystery since the first one was detected in 2007.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That year, researchers scouring archived data from Australia's Parkes Radio Telescope in search of new pulsars found the first known FRB -- one that had burst in 2001.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There now are 18 known FRBs. All were discovered using single-dish radio telescopes that are unable to narrow down the object's location with enough precision to allow other observatories to identify its host environment or to find it at other wavelengths. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike all the others, however, one FRB, discovered in November of 2012 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, has recurred numerous times.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The repeating bursts from this object, named FRB 121102 after the date of the initial burst, allowed astronomers to watch for it using the US National Science Foundation's (NSF) Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), a multi-antenna radio telescope system with the resolving power, or ability to see fine detail, needed to precisely determine the object's location in the sky.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 83 hours of observing time over six months in 2016, the VLA detected nine bursts from FRB 121102.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For a long time, we came up empty, then got a string of bursts that gave us exactly what we needed,&amp;quot; Casey Law of the University of California at Berkeley said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The VLA data allowed us to narrow down the position very accurately,&amp;quot; Sarah Burke-Spolaor, of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) and West Virginia University, pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using the precise VLA position, researchers used the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii to make a visible-light image that identified a faint dwarf galaxy at the location of the bursts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gemini observations also determined that the dwarf galaxy is more than three billion light-years from Earth, according to the study published in the journal Nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Finding the host galaxy of this FRB, and its distance, is a big step forward, but we still have much more to do before we fully understand what these things are,&amp;quot; Chatterjee said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 5 (IANS) Aiming to find important clues to the earliest history of the solar system, NASA has announced two missions -- one to explore Jupiter's mysterious Trojan asteroids and the other to study a unique metal asteroid.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The missions, known as Lucy and Psyche, were chosen from five finalists and will proceed to mission formulation, with the goal of launching in 2021 and 2023, respectively, NASA said in a statement on Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Lucy will visit a target-rich environment of Jupiter's mysterious Trojan asteroids, while Psyche will study a unique metal asteroid that's never been visited before,&amp;quot; said Thomas Zurbuchen, Associate Administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is what Discovery Program missions are all about - boldly going to places we've never been to enable groundbreaking science,&amp;quot; Zurbuchen added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy, a robotic spacecraft, is scheduled for October 2021 launch. It is slated to arrive at its first destination, a main belt asteroid, in 2025. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From 2027 to 2033, Lucy will explore six Jupiter Trojan asteroids. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These asteroids are trapped by Jupiter's gravity in two swarms that share the planet's orbit, one leading and one trailing Jupiter in its 12-year circuit around the sun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Trojans are thought to be relics of a much earlier era in the history of the solar system, and may have formed far beyond Jupiter's current orbit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is a unique opportunity,&amp;quot; said Harold Levison, Principal Investigator of the Lucy mission from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Because the Trojans are remnants of the primordial material that formed the outer planets, they hold vital clues to deciphering the history of the solar system. Lucy, like the human fossil for which it is named, will revolutionize the understanding of our origins,&amp;quot; Levison noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Psyche mission will explore one of the most intriguing targets in the main asteroid belt - a giant metal asteroid, known as 16 Psyche, about three times farther away from the sun than is the Earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This asteroid measures about 130 miles (210 kilometers) in diameter and, unlike most other asteroids that are rocky or icy bodies, is thought to be comprised mostly of metallic iron and nickel, similar to Earth's core. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mission will help scientists understand how planets and other bodies separated into their layers - including cores, mantles and crusts - early in their histories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Psyche, also a robotic mission, is targeted to launch in October of 2023, arriving at the asteroid in 2030, following an Earth gravity assist spacecraft maneuvre in 2024 and a Mars flyby in 2025.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bengaluru, Jan 5 (IANS) For most Indians, tsunami became a household word after the 2004 disaster that pounded the country's eastern coast and killed several thousands.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But researchers at the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in Goa have found that ancient Indians of the Harappan settlement (some 5,000 years ago) were aware of tsunamis and had taken measures to protect themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reporting this in the &amp;quot;Current Science&amp;quot; journal, they say this conclusion is based on their new interpretation of the extraordinarily massive walls -- of thickness up to 18 metres -- found at Dholavira, a Harappan city in Gujarat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dholavira is the second-largest Harappan settlement known in India and, perhaps, the best-planned Harappan city with several divisions and many new features hitherto unknown, they say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to their report, the architectural framework of Dholavira comprises a castle, a middle town and a lower town confined within massive walls, &amp;quot;making it a unique fortified settlement&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The presence of extremely thick protective walls implies that the Dholavirans were probably aware of the magnitude of destruction caused by tsunami waves, says the report. According to the NIO team, the ancient Indians would not have built these huge walls for protection against floods or military invasion by enemies since these threats did not exist then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dholavira is located on the banks of small water channels -- Mansar in the north and Manhar in the south -- the researchers say. &amp;quot;Therefore, it is highly unlikely that these channels posed any flood-related risk to the people since the elevation of Dholavira settlement is sufficiently high&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The possibility that these walls were built for defensive purpose was also ruled out since the only weapons available during the Harappan days were &amp;quot;sling shots and bows and arrows&amp;quot;. Even the Great Wall of China is only about nine metres thick at the base and tapers to 3.7 metres at the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, being close to the sea, Dholavira could have been vulnerable to oceanic calamities. The sea-level changes are well-documented for the western coast of India and, 4,000 years ago, the sea level was higher than at present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Being on the Makran coast, the area is prone to tsunami-like events,&amp;quot; the researchers say and point out that simulation studies have concluded that tsunami wave height along the Gujarat coast ranges from 2 to 10 metres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There is a traditional history of tsunami waves and strong storms hitting the Gujarat coast,&amp;quot; says the report. &amp;quot;A 3.5 metre high tsunami wave reportedly hit the Gujarat coast about 2,000 years ago.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Harappan Indians were apparently aware of this threat and &amp;quot;therefore we hypothesise that the massive walls of the Dholavira might have been a protective measure against possible tsunamis,&amp;quot; the researchers say.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(K.S.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 5 (IANS) Four people have been arrested by the Chicago police after a Facebook Live video showed a reportedly mentally disabled man being brutally beaten with the attackers shouting obscenities against President-elect Donald Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in the Chicago Tribune, the video showed a group of people, including a woman, cutting the shirt off a white man with his mouth taped shut, cutting his hair off with a knife and pushing his head with foot and using profanity against Trump and &amp;quot;white people&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The police believes the victim had disappeared from his residence and then met someone he mistook for a friend, leading to his involvement with a group of people who also allegedly stole a van.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Not long after police found the man on Tuesday, officers were called to the home in the 3300 block of West Lexington about 5:25 p.m., and found signs of a struggle and property damage that they linked to the man,&amp;quot; the report said quoting the police. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The man was taken to a local hospital for treatment and later discharged,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The original video had been removed by Wednesday evening but it was re-posted widely by people on YouTube and other sites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's sickening. It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that. I have been a cop for 28 years and I have seen things that you should not see. It still amazes me how you still see things that you just should not,&amp;quot; said Eddie Johnson, Superintendent, Chicago Police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police is questioning the four accused and has taken videotaped statements from them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ap&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 5 (IANS) Researchers have spotted for the first time an extremely rare type of galaxy whose elliptical-like core is surrounded by two circular rings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Approximately 359 million light years away from the Earth, the galaxy appears to belong to a class of rarely observed, Hoag-type galaxies, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Less than 0.1 per cent of all observed galaxies are Hoag-type galaxies,&amp;quot; said lead author Burcin Mutlu-Pakdil from the University of Minnesota at Duluth in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hoag-type galaxies are round cores surrounded by a circular ring, with nothing visibly connecting them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The majority of observed galaxies are disc-shaped like our own Milky Way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxies with unusual appearances give astronomers unique insights into how galaxies are formed and change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers collected multi-waveband images of the galaxy, which is easily observable only in the Southern Hemisphere, using a large diameter telescope in the Chilean mountains. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These images were used to determine the age of the two main features of the galaxy, the outer ring and the central body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the researchers found a blue and young (0.13 billion years) outer ring, surrounding a red and older (5.5 billion years) central core, they were surprised to uncover evidence for second inner ring around the central body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To document this second ring, researchers took their images and subtracted out a model of the core. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This allowed them to observe and measure the obscured, second inner ring structure, according to a study published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We've observed galaxies with a blue ring around a central red body before, the most well-known of these is Hoag's object. However, the unique feature of this galaxy is what appears to be an older diffuse red inner ring,&amp;quot; said the co-author of the study, Patrick Treuthardt, an astrophysicist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy rings are regions where stars have formed from colliding gas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The different colours of the inner and outer ring suggest that this galaxy has experienced two different formation periods,&amp;quot; Mutlu-Pakdil said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt/ap&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Moscow, Jan 5 (IANS) A hacker has claimed to have breached the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's website and leaked personal account information to a public site, media reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hacker, known as CyberZeist, exploited a zero-day vulnerability in the highly-secured Plone Content Management System (CMS) of the FBI's website and leaked some of the information to Pastebin, an open source site that is often used by hackers to post stolen information and bits of code, RT.com reported on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A zero-day fault is a vulnerability in the code that has not been detected, listed, or patched yet. Therefore, the FBI had zero days to respond to the attack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not the first time the hacker claimed breaching the FBI site. In 2011, CyberZeist is believed to have hacked the FBI site as a member of a group known as Anonymous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Authorities in the US have not yet responded to the recent hacking incident that was claimed to have occurred last month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;fbi.gov CMS Exploited, files in view - PasswordResetTool.py, product permissions, setup file. More coming soon #FBI #PWNED,&amp;quot; the hacker had tweeted on December 22.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Don't blame the #hacker, blame the faulty #code!,&amp;quot; CyberZeist had said in another tweet on December 27.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CyberZeist warned other agencies that are currently using the Plone CMS that they too are vulnerable to a similar attack. &amp;quot;Amnesty acknowledges to patch the Plone #vulnerability in their CMS, just in time!,&amp;quot; CyberZeist said in a recent tweet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/na/ap&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The successful test launch of the vehicle in November in South China's Hainan Province will pave the way for space station construction, analysts said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wang Yu, general director of the Long March-5 program, said 2017 is a critical year for China's new generation of carrier rockets and the Long March-5 rockets will carry Chang'e-5 probe to the space. The probe will land on the moon, collect samples and return to Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, Long March-7, the more powerful version of Long March-2, will send China's first cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1 into the space in the first half of 2017, according to Wang Zhaoyao, director of China Manned Space Engineering Office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tianzhou-1 is expected to dock with Tiangong-2 space lab and conduct experiments on propellant supplement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China conducted 22 launch missions in 2016 and 19 in 2015. The country successfully tested its Long March-7 rocket in June last year and has gradually shifted to new generation rockets that reduce the use of toxic rocket fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last Month, China released a white paper on space activities, announcing plans to soft land Chang'e-5 on the moon by the end of 2017 and launch its first Mars probe by 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ksk&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Las Vegas, Jan 5 (IANS) With an aim to deliver tailor-made devices to customers to meet their needs and fit their usage habits, Chinese tech giant Lenovo on Thursday announced a new range of laptop and tablet products at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show (CES 2017) here.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lenovo showcased its premium work and play experience device ThinkPad X1, Miix 720 detachable, new gaming sub-brand Lenovo Legion and two laptops under the new sub-brand -- Lenovo Legion Y720 and Lenovo Legion Y520 Laptop at the event.

\&amp;quot;Our approach to innovation is to ensure we are constantly evolving and understanding how technology is infused within every individual, business and home,\&amp;quot; Gianfranco Lanci, President and Chief Operating Officer at Lenovo, told reporters here.

The next generation of ThinkPad X1 products cater to the need of professionals who blur the line between work and personal PC use.

Lenovo\'s 5th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon -- available in classic ThinkPad Black and new metallic silver colours -- is the lightest 14-inch business notebook that weighs just 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg) and packs a 14-inch IPS display into a new sleek 13-inch form factor.

The new X1 Carbon offers up to 15 hours of battery life and has been redesigned to include Thunderbolt 3 ports (the fastest port available on a PC), super-fast LTE-A Wireless WAN and WiFi certified WiGig options that deliver superior performance and connectivity.

\&amp;quot;Over 80 per cent of our consumers were concerned about battery life. Other thing the customers were worried about is colours, so we are now offering a choice of silver colour this year,\&amp;quot; Dilip Bhatia, Vice President of Global Marketing, User and Customer Experience Lenovo PC and Smart Device Business Group, said.

Taking a note of increased cybercrime threats, the new device offers enhanced security features.

It comes with a fingerprint sensor with a dedicated chip that handles biometric processing and helps secure and simplify the Windows Hello login experience with a new face recognition Infrared camera.  

Adding to the list is the updated ThinkPad X1 Yoga which is flawlessly flexible, offers true multi-mode capabilities and delivers stunning colours on the only 14-inch notebook with an OLED screen.

Also, a redesigned rechargeable pen and improved \&amp;quot;rise and fall\&amp;quot; keyboard complete the improved experience.

\&amp;quot;Rise and Fall\&amp;quot; feature pulls in the keys of the device when working in tablet mode, giving a flat surface feeling. Also when a user folds the laptop after turning it off, it again pulls in the keys to keep the display free from any marks and scratches.

Alongside continuing to impress with its lightweight, modularity and serviceability is the ThinkPad X1 Tablet. The device has unique modules that offer port expansion and up to five hours of additional battery life and an integrated projector option.

Meanwhile, the Miix 720 Windows detachable combines a 12-inch QHD+ display and precision touchpad-enabled keyboard with up to 7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor and Thunderbolt 3.

One can simply remove the keyboard to instantly transform the Miix 720 into a touchscreen tablet. Paired with a multifaceted Lenovo Active Pen 2, the Miix 720 is ideal for effortless note taking or bringing creative concepts to life.

\&amp;quot;Why Mixx 720 is better than its competitors? Its simple; the 150-degree tablet kickstand easily adjusts to the users\' preferred viewing angle, ensuring comfort and entertainment,\&amp;quot; Bhatia added.

The Thunderbolt Lenovo Active Pen 2 is sold separately and may be hard bundled or optional depending on the geography.

Also to meet the evolving needs of the gaming community, the company also launched a new gaming sub-brand Lenovo Legion and two powerful gaming machines under this name -- Lenovo Legion Y720 Laptop and Lenovo Legion Y520 Laptop.

\&amp;quot;The reason why we launched these gaming laptops is we needed to provide legitimacy to our product. Legion is all about the community of gamers. In future we will have a line of gaming desktops under the legion sub-brand,\&amp;quot; Bhatia noted.

The new devices allow a greater gaming experience powering VR through the latest NVIDIA graphics, sound with Dolby Atmos and increased performance with the 7th Gen Intel Core i7 processor.

The devices ThinkPad X1 Carbon -- which starts from $1,349 -- and ThinkPad X1 Yoga -- which starts from $1,499 -- will be available in February.

While ThinkPad X1 Tablet (starts from $949) will be available in March, Miix 720 (keyboard included) which starts at $999.99 will be available in two colour options champagne and iron gray beginning in April 2017.

Lenovo Active Pen 2 starts at $59.99 will be available beginning in February.

While, the Lenovo Legion Y720 Laptop is price range starts from $1,399.99 and will available from April, Lenovo Legion Y520 Laptop will be available from February at price range starting $899.99.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 5 (IANS) US President-elect Donald Trump will meet top US intelligence officials in New York on Friday to analyse the issue of Russian cyberattacks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participating in the meeting, among others, will be CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Chief James Comey and National Intelligence Director James Clapper, a spokesman for Trump said on Wednesday, Efe news reported.

The meeting would focus on analyzing the evidence gathered by the Barack Obama administration\'s intelligence team on Russian cyberattacks during the US presidential election campaign, which Trump won on November 8.

A spokesman for Trump\'s transition team said in the daily telephonic conference with reporters that the meeting was requested last week by the transition team and was to be held once an official report had been prepared.

Spokesman Sean Spicer said that the meeting was ultimately scheduled for Friday, although it is not known if Trump or the presidential transition team will make any comment about it afterwards.

In a Twitter message, Trump had said that the meeting had been \&amp;quot;delayed\&amp;quot; until Friday and added \&amp;quot;Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!\&amp;quot;

In remarks last week in Florida, Trump cast doubt on the implication that Russian authorities had ordered the hacking, adding that it was time to focus on more important matters.

When Spicer was asked what Trump based his skepticism about Russian hacking on, he said on Wednesday that the president-elect wants be given all the data and the conclusions that intelligence officials have drawn from them.

\&amp;quot;I think what he wants to hear from them is, how does the raw intelligence justify the conclusion that is being presented...?\&amp;quot; Spicer said.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 4 (IANS) The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Wednesday floated a consultation paper on the much-debated net neutrality issue, seeking stakeholders view by February 15, and counter-comments by February 28.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The net neutrality issue has left the telecom service providers (TSP) and the over-the-top (OTT) players in India at loggerheads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Transparency is one of the key enabling factors towards ensuring adherence to the nondiscrimination principles set forth in any net neutrality framework,&amp;quot; the consultation paper said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In an net neutrality context, the scope of transparency obligations can range from obligations cast upon TSPs to disclose technical information on QoS (quality of services) parameters, to providing high level information that is widely understandable and may enable consumers to make more informed decisions, and detect violations,&amp;quot; it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the scope of transparency obligations, the paper has put thrust on price information and commercial terms and traffic management practices along with many other characteristics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consultation paper asked stakeholders: &amp;quot;What could be the principles for ensuring nondiscriminatory access to content on the Internet, in the Indian context?&amp;quot; and how should &amp;quot;Internet traffic&amp;quot; and providers of &amp;quot;Internet services&amp;quot; be understood in the NN context?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It sought views of the regulators on reasonable traffic management practices as well as regarding what would be the most effective legal/policy instrument for implementing a net neutrality framework in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Timeline of net neutrality related activities:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;January 19, 2015 - Creation of DoT committee on net neutrality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;March 27, 2015 - Consultation on regulatory framework for OTT services&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May 2015 - Release of DoT committee report on net neutrality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;December 9, 2015 - Consultation on differential pricing for data services&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;February 8, 2016 - Regulation on prohibition of discriminatory tariffs for data services&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;March 3, 2016 - DoT sought Authority's recommendations on net neutrality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May 19, 2016 - Consultation on free data &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May 30, 2016 - Pre-consultation on net neutrality&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;December 19, 2016 - Recommendations on provisioning of free data&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

These are just a couple of the 25 ideas that Bengaluru-based TeamIndus has shortlisted in its bid to find suitable experiments to fly aboard its lunar spacecraft scheduled for launch in 2017.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More than 3,000 teams participated in TeamIndus' Lab2Moon competition, a global challenge for students under 25 years of age to imagine, design and build a project that could accelerate human evolution into a sustainable multi planetary species, the company said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are absolutely thrilled that as many as 3000 teams from all around the world participated in this race to the Moon,&amp;quot; said Rahul Narayan, TeamIndus Fleet Commander.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The shortlisted teams have each been assigned mentors from TeamIndus, each of whom will work closely with the teams to ensure that the standards needed for space grade experiments are observed and maintained, the statement added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The winning experiments will be announced in March 2017, said TeamIndus that recently signed a launch contract to land a spacecraft on the Moon with Indian space agency Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TeamIndus is the only Indian team competing for the Google Lunar XPrize. For demonstrating its landing technology, TeamIndus has already won a $1 million milestone prize.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal of the $30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE is to ignite a new era of space exploration by lowering the cost and inspiring the imagination of the next generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 4 (IANS) Urbanisation is affecting the genetic makeup of species that are crucial to the ecosystem health and success, says a study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings open new opportunities for advancing our understanding of the role of humans in Earth's evolution, said lead author Marina Alberti from University of Washington. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;By explicitly linking urban development to heritable traits that affect ecosystem function, we can begin to map the implications of human-induced trait changes for ecological and human well being,&amp;quot; Alberti noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rapid urbanisation poses new challenges for species, some of which will adapt or relocate while others go extinct, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this study, they sought to learn whether signs of human-caused change could be detected across species in urban ecosystems worldwide, and to what extent humans and our cities and societies might be speeding up these changes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They analysed 1,600 observations of phenotypic change -- alterations to species' observable traits such as size, development or behaviour --  across multiple regions and ecosystems worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They also assessed the relative impact of several human-caused &amp;quot;urban disturbances,&amp;quot; including the acidification and pollution of lake habitats, the relocation of animals, heat and effluents associated with a power plant, long-term harvesting of certain medicinal plants -- even the apparent effects of global warming on the reproductive patterns of birds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We found a clear urban signal of phenotypic change -- and greater phenotypic change in urbanising systems compared to natural and non-urban anthropogenic, or human-created systems,&amp;quot; Alberti said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The significance of these changes is that they affect the functioning of ecosystems,&amp;quot; Alberti said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They may inhibit the ability of seeds to disperse, cause exposure to infectious diseases, or even change the migratory patterns of some species,&amp;quot; Alberti noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 4 (IANS) A new video game-based app that targets underlying cognitive issues in older adults diagnosed with late-life depression, has showed promise for treating the condition, researchers say.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app -- called 'Project: EVO' or an in-person therapy technique known as problem-solving therapy (PST) -- runs on phones and tablets and is designed to improve focus and attention at a basic neurological level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results showed that individuals who used the app demonstrated specific cognitive benefits such as attention, compared to the behavioural therapy and saw similar improvements in mood and self-reported function. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The study found that moderately depressed people do better with apps like this because they address or treat correlates of depression,&amp;quot; said Patricia Arean, Professor at University of Washington in Seattle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People with late-life depression (60+) are known to have trouble focusing their attention on personal goals and report trouble concentrating because they are so distracted by their worries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app was designed to help people better focus their attention and to prevent people from being easily distracted, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While EVO was not directly designed to treat depressive symptoms, we hypothesised that there may indeed be beneficial effects on these symptoms by improving cognitive issues with targeted treatment, and so far, the results are promising,&amp;quot; added Joaquin A. Anguera from University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the team enrolled older adults diagnosed with late-life depression into a treatment trial where they were randomised to receive the app-based treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was published in the journal Depression and Anxiety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Jan 4 (IANS) Worldwide combined shipments of PCs, tablets, ultramobiles and mobile phones are projected to total 2.3 billion in 2017, same as 2016 estimates, according to market research firm Gartner.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By the end of 2016, there were nearly seven billion phones, tablets and PCs in use in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gartner predicts flat shipments of traditional devices until 2018, when a small increase in ultramobiles and mobile phone shipments is expected. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The global devices market is stagnating. Mobile phone shipments are only growing in emerging Asia/Pacific markets, and the PC market is just reaching the bottom of its decline,&amp;quot; said Ranjit Atwal, Research Director at Gartner.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The PC market is expected to benefit from a replacement cycle towards the end of this forecast period, returning to growth in 2018, Gartner noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research firm noted that as traditional PC sales are showing a decline, premium ultramobile prices and functionality will entice buyers and the mobile phone market will also benefit from replacements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;People in emerging markets still see smartphones as their main computing device and replace them more regularly than mature markets,&amp;quot; said Atwal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Device vendors are increasingly trying to move into faster-growing emerging device categories but this requires a shift from a hardware-focused approach to a richer value-added service approach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As service-led approaches become even more crucial, hardware providers will have to partner with service providers, as they lack the expertise to deliver the service offerings themselves,&amp;quot; said Atwal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/vgu/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 4 (IANS) Aiming to give a technological edge to the small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday announced two initiatives \'Digital Unlocked\' and \'My Business Website\'.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;Small businesses are the backbone of India\'s economy. Internet is for everyone,\&amp;quot; Pichai said, addressing the media here.

\&amp;quot;The Internet is a powerful equaliser and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible,\&amp;quot; he said. 

\&amp;quot;Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystem,\&amp;quot; Pichai added.

Pichai said that Google, along with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), has developed a training programme called \'Digital Unlocked\', to empower thousands of Indian SMBs with essential digital skills that would enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their businesses. 

The programme would be certified by Google, Ficci and Indian School of Business - Hyderabad. It would offer online and mobile courses to SMBs across the country. 

\&amp;quot;We plan to impart 5,000 training workshops in 40 cities in three years,\&amp;quot; he added.

The global search giant also started another initiative \'My Business Website\'. It is a free tool, which would help make a website in 10 minutes.

\&amp;quot;Any small business can sign up. Internet is as much for the local players as it is for a high-flying one. It will first start in India (later this year), and then will be launched in other countries,\&amp;quot; Pichai said.

\'My Business Website\' would be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam languages. 

There are around 51 million small and medium scale businesses in India. Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled \&amp;quot;Impact of internet and digitization on SMBs in India\&amp;quot;, which said that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs were offline.

\&amp;quot;Profits grow twice as fast for those SMBs who have digital business,\&amp;quot; Google\'s Vice President, South-East Asia and India,  Rajan Anandan said.

The micro small and medium entreprises contribute 37 per cent to the Indian gross domestic products (GDP), he added.

Further, for India\'s mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. 

Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi. Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions are coming up shortly.

Appreciating all the initiatives by Google, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: \&amp;quot;Google is as much an Indian company as American.\&amp;quot;

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 4 (IANS) Bharat Ratna awardee and internationally-renowned chemist C.N.R. Rao has said that former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was very supportive when it came to science and much was done for science and technology during his tenure, while also hoping that Narendra Modi too will consult good scientists.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;Dr. Manmohan Singh was a good Prime Minister to work with. We could do many things in science and technology during his tenure. He was very promotive. We look forward to a promising future with Prime Minister Modi.

\&amp;quot;Trust that he will consult a cross-section of good scientists and chalk out a road map for the development of science and technology in India, so that India becomes a really advanced, sophisticated nation,\&amp;quot; Rao told IANS in an email interview from Bengaluru.

The author of over 1,500 research papers and 45 scientific books, Rao shared his perspectives on his memoir, \&amp;quot;A Life in Science\&amp;quot;, which was released last November.

\&amp;quot;Science is important for India and the rest of the world. Nobody can deny this. Only those countries which are advanced in science rule the world. We have to do a lot more for science in India.

\&amp;quot;Independent of the government that is ruling, we have to realise that science and technology give the basic foundation for development and economic progress,\&amp;quot; Rao noted.

\&amp;quot;Prime Minister Modi has great vision and wants to do much for India and I am sure that he knows that only a country with a strong base in science and technology can lead the world and also solve problems that we are facing in innovation and industrial development,\&amp;quot; he added.

In \&amp;quot;A Life in Science\&amp;quot;, the noted chemist talks about his journey into the discipline, giving readers valuable insights into what it takes to become a great scientist.

\&amp;quot;I faced many odds and limitations in carrying out competitive research in India. However, with tenacity and perseverance, I have often changed the nature and even the direction of the research where and when necessary to suit the conditions and available facilities,\&amp;quot; he recalled.

Rao, however, said that in the last 15-20 years, he has had facilities of the kind \&amp;quot;where I can do exactly what I want, but it took a long time before I could get such facilities\&amp;quot;.

\&amp;quot;The main thing is to have patience and perseverance. These are important qualities for succeeding in India. Another important aspect is the choice of the research problem. One has to pick the right kind of problem that one can pursue,\&amp;quot; he said.

\&amp;quot;A Life in Science\&amp;quot; provides a rare glimpse into the life of one of the most eminent, dedicated and widely-respected scientists of post-Independence India.

\&amp;quot;In spite of many difficulties I have faced in the early days, and certain limitations that one faces even today,\&amp;quot; Rao said, \&amp;quot;I consider myself to be a happy man after over 60 years of research in India. I have had a wonderful career and I have enjoyed everything that I have done.\&amp;quot;

Responding to a question on the areas where Modi can focus more with regard to science, Rao said that there are three types of scientific research required in India.

\&amp;quot;Firstly, India should promote blue sky research independent of its applications so that India is competent in the latest developments of science. Then, we should work on main pressing problems of mankind such as energy, water, environment, disease, etc. And finally we should also work on problems unique to India and those of value to our industrial progress,\&amp;quot; he advised.

In the book, Rao regrets that since independence, we have given \&amp;quot;undue importance to big science, while small science is ignored\&amp;quot;.

Elaborating, he said: \&amp;quot;There is no question that much of the money goes to big science agencies and real scientists working in the small laboratories get little. It is what I call little science that makes science progress and solves problems facing humankind.

\&amp;quot;It is high time that we make sure that real science is not ignored. I feel that the government should work out methods of supporting science as well as the priorities that they would like to pick on. Independent of what priorities are picked, frontline basic research has to be supported,\&amp;quot; Rao argued.

Rao is a member of almost all the major science academies in the world and is a recipient of the Dan David Prize for materials research. He also has honorary doctorates from 70 universities.

\&amp;quot;I have been doing research for 65 years of my life and 57 years as a member of a faculty and professor. I have gone through challenging times when we had no money and eventually built an outstanding laboratory that I have for the last few years. What we require is patience, tenacity and doggedness.

\&amp;quot;With these qualities, I am sure that young people will succeed. However, I do hope that there will be better funding in the years to come for fundamental research in important areas and also for the higher education sector for rejuvenation of our universities,\&amp;quot; Rao concluded.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 4 (IANS) Green innovations must be developed and spread globally 10 times faster than in the past if we are to limit warming to below the Paris Agreement's two degrees Celsius target, says a study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Based on our calculations, we won't meet the climate warming goals set by the Paris Agreement unless we speed up the spread of clean technology by a full order of magnitude, or about ten times faster than in the past,&amp;quot; said lead researcher Gabriele Manoli from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Radically new strategies to implement technological advances on a global scale and at unprecedented rates are needed if current emissions goals are to be achieved,&amp;quot; Manoli said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study used delayed differential equations to calculate the pace at which global per-capita emissions of carbon dioxide have increased since the Second Industrial Revolution -- a period of rapid industrialisation at the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The analysis showed that per-capita CO2 emissions have increased about 100 per cent every 60 years -- typically in big jumps -- since then. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers then compared this pace to the speed of new innovations in low-carbon-emitting technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using these historical trends coupled with projections of future global population growth, Manoli and his colleagues were able to estimate the likely pace of future emissions increases and also determine the speed at which climate-friendly technological innovation and implementation must occur to hold warming below the Paris Agreement's two degrees Celsius target.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's no longer enough to have emissions-reducing technologies,&amp;quot; Manoli said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We must scale them up and spread them globally at unprecedented speeds,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings were published in the journal Earth's Future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 4 (IANS) A new technology can wireless charge almost any device including those without in-built wireless charging capabilities, such as Apple's iPhone and iPad.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wireless charger developed by a French start-up, called Energysquare, was witnessed by CNET during the on-going CES trade show in Las Vegas. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Energysquare consists of a charging pad and a sticker that is placed on the back of a device. The sticker sports two electrodes along with a Micro-USB, USB-C or Lightning connector that is plugged into the device's charging port. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the device is placed on the pad, it starts charging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the limitations of the sticker is that it blocks the device's charging port and if you want to charge the device normal way, the sticker needs to be removed -- a flaw the company has acknowledged and promised that the upgraded version will include a port on the backside as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Unlike other wireless chargers, which use electromagnetic induction, Energysquare relies on electric conduction. This allows for multiple devices to charge at once and at speeds that are comparable to a normal charge,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Energysquare is priced at $89 and comes with a charging pad and five stickers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report on CNET on Tuesday, the company launched a Kickstarter campaign in May 2016 and is promising to ship the product in the coming months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 4 (IANS) NASA said on Wednesday it plans to launch in 2020 a $188 million mission that will allow astronomers to explore, for the first time, the hidden details of some of the most extreme and exotic astronomical objects, such as stellar and supermassive black holes, neutron stars and pulsars.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Objects such as black holes can heat surrounding gases to more than a million degrees. The high-energy X-ray radiation from this gas can be polarised - vibrating in a particular direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) mission will fly three space telescopes with cameras capable of measuring the polarisation of these cosmic X-rays, allowing scientists to answer fundamental questions about these turbulent and extreme environments where gravitational, electric and magnetic fields are at their limits, the US space agency said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We cannot directly image what's going on near objects like black holes and neutron stars, but studying the polarisation of X-rays emitted from their surrounding environments reveals the physics of these enigmatic objects,&amp;quot; said Paul Hertz from the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;IXPE will open a new window on the universe for astronomers to peer through. Today, we can only guess what we will find,&amp;quot; Hertz noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA's Astrophysics Explorers Program requested proposals for new missions in September 2014. Fourteen proposals were submitted, and three mission concepts were selected for additional review by a panel of agency and external scientists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA determined the IXPE proposal provided the best science potential and most feasible development plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ball Aerospace in Broomfield, Colorado, will provide the spacecraft and mission integration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Italian Space Agency will contribute the polarisation sensitive X-ray detectors, which were developed in Italy, NASA said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The companies are also expected to showcase their products with the onus on Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) at the event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CES is an annual trade show organised by the US Consumer Technology Association.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Held every year in January at the Las Vegas Convention Centre, the event typically hosts presentations of new products and technologies in the consumer electronics industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What to expect from the show:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Connected and self-driving cars: Although 2016 was marred by some technological failures in self-driving cars, the year also saw a couple of successful test runs in the US. Uber had ordered Swedish car maker Volvo for a fleet of self-driving cars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from the top auto manufacturers, including Nissan, Honda and Hyundai, Apple was also reportedly involved in providing the software for the self-driving cars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CES 2017 may witness new, more intelligent driverless technology that would make the cars smarter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultra high Definition TVs: With 4K TVs from giants like Samsung and LG made it to markets last year, 2017 may witness new, better but low-cost technology in this segment that will allow developing countries to buy these TVs. Watch out for Sony, Samsung, LG and TCL.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smartphone: Smartphone technology had been dominating last few editions of the CES. This time smartphones may take a break as the industry has become too crowded. In fact, the smartphone vendors may now focus on VR and AR technology with new releases in VR headsets and 360 degree cameras at lower prices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from that, some companies may also unveil teasers of products for a launch at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) to be held at Barcelona in February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drones have also proven their mettle in the past year and 2017 may see a boom in the technology that may be used at a number of areas, including military, agriculture, security, among others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CES-2017 may witness new releases in IoT with independent companies delving out more secure IoT devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaming laptops headlined 2016 with ASUS and Acer coming up with over-the-top product series. New powerful devices may come up at this year's event.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in USA today, nearly 175,000 people are expected to attend the show this year witnessing products and services from over 3,800 exhibitors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Sourabh Kulesh is attending CES-2017 in Las Vegas at the invitation of Lenovo.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 4 (IANS) South Korea will strengthen efforts and policies in 2017 aimed at pushing North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programs, an official statement said on Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The measures would include implementing more unilateral sanctions and increasing international pressure, Efe news reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ministries on Wednesday presented South Korea's acting President and Prime Minister, Hwang Kyo-ahn, with their policy directions for 2017, which agree on boosting efforts to put an end to North Korean arms development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This year, North Korea insist to be recognised as a nuclear state and continue to bypass our inter-Korean policy and international sanctions regime,&amp;quot; the Unification Ministry said in a statement, adding that it would implement new unilateral sanctions, according to Yonhap news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Foreign Ministry also said it wanted to strengthen its bilateral ties with countries such as the US, China and Japan, and called for reinforcing efforts to &amp;quot;choke off the money flow into the North, isolate it diplomatically and coordinate with major countries for unilateral sanctions.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, announced that it would create in 2017 -- two years ahead of schedule -- a special brigade tasked with incapacitating the North Korean regime's command structure to counter developing military threats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seoul believes that Pyongyang has around 40 kg of plutonium, with which it could produce four to eight nuclear weapons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ministry of Defence would also advance the deployment of missile-detection armaments -- originally planned for mid-2020 -- and move forward with installations of the US THAAD anti-missile system, based in South Korea, according to Yonhap.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Foreign Ministry said it believed Pyongyang could carry out a &amp;quot;strategic or tactical provocation&amp;quot; in the coming months after the New Year speech of leader Kim Jong-un, in which he said North Korean intercontinental experimental missiles were in the &amp;quot;final phase&amp;quot; of development.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North Korea has already launched six intercontinental ballistic missiles on six occasions, claiming that the launches were aimed at orbiting observation satellites.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;North Korea conducted two nuclear tests in 2016 - following the single blasts in 2006, 2009 and 2013 - and launched about 20 ballistic missiles, including half-range Musudan projectiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;in/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Jan 4 (IANS) China plans to conduct some 30 space launch missions in 2017, a record-breaking number in the country's space history, said China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long March-5 and Long March-7 rockets would be used to carry out most of the space missions, the China News Service reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Long March-5 is China's largest carrier rocket. The successful test launch of the vehicle in November in Hainan would pave the way for space station construction, analysts said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wang Yu, general director of the Long March-5 program, said 2017 is a critical year for China's new generation of carrier rockets and the Long March-5 rockets would carry Chang'e-5 probe to space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The probe would land on the moon, collect samples and return to Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, Long March-7, the more powerful version of Long March-2, would send China's first cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1 into the space in the first half of 2017, according to Wang Zhaoyao, director of China Manned Space Engineering Office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tianzhou-1 was expected to dock with Tiangong-2 space lab and conduct experiments on propellant supplement, People's Daily reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China conducted 22 launch missions in 2016 and 19 in 2015. The country successfully tested its Long March-7 rocket in June 2016, and has gradually shifted to new generation rockets that reduce the use of toxic rocket fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;in/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 4 (IANS) Democratic leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer has slammed President-elect Donald Trump for his twitter habit, claiming the US cannot afford &amp;quot;Twitter presidency&amp;quot; on the first day of the 115th session of the Congress.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;'Making America Great Again' requires more than 140 characters per issue,&amp;quot; Xinhua news agency quoted Schumer as saying in his first speech on Tuesday as the Senate minority leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency. We have real challenges and we need to get real things done.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Schumer warned the incoming President will fail if he sticks with a &amp;quot;Twitter presidency&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Many Americans are afraid, Mr. President-elect, that instead of rolling up your sleeves and forging serious policies... for you, Twitter suffices,&amp;quot; he told the Senate chamber.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There's nothing wrong with using Twitter to speak to the American people,&amp;quot; Schumer said. &amp;quot;It's a good use of modern media. But these issues are complex and demand both careful consideration and action. We cannot tweet them away.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If Trump lets the hard-right members of the Congress and his cabinet run the show, if he attempts to adopt their time-worn policies which benefit the elites, the special interests, corporate America -- not the working man and woman -- his presidency will not succeed,&amp;quot; Schumer said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Maybe not in the first 90 days, but certainly not in the first two years.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Democrat said Trump's tweet &amp;quot;bragging&amp;quot; about the 800 jobs he saved at the Carrier plant in Indiana &amp;quot;doesn't solve the underlying problem&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While it's good the 800 jobs were saved... even at Carrier, 1,300 jobs are still leaving, hundreds more at the nearby Rexnord plant that are going overseas, and most importantly, thousands more each month leave our shores from every part of America,&amp;quot; Schumer said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democrats are &amp;quot;going to hold the President-elect accountable for a real policy to stop jobs from leaving the country&amp;quot;, Schumer said, adding that his party will work with Trump and Republicans to create more jobs and improve the country's transportation systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;py/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Translating this basic knowledge into innovations, start-ups and industry will help us achieve inclusive and sustainable growth,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Prime Minister said that by 2030, India would be among the top three countries in science and technology. &amp;quot;Science must meet the rising aspirations of the people.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We must address the problems of urban-rural divide and work for inclusive development, economic growth and employment generation. To enable this, there is a need for a new overarching structure that will coordinate with all the relevant stakeholders,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said some of the important challenges for the nation were in the key sectors of clean water and energy, food, environment, climate, security and healthcare. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We equally need to keep an eye on the rise of disruptive technologies and be prepared to leverage them for growth. We need to clearly assess the challenges and opportunities for our technology readiness and competitiveness,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Modi noted that the Technology Vision 2035 document released at last year's Science Congress, was now developing into a detailed roadmap for 12 key technology sectors. Further, the NITI Aayog was evolving a holistic science and technology vision for the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Union Minister for Science and Technology Harsh Vardhan, Andhra Pradesh Governor E.S.L.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 3 (IANS) Contradicting a prevalent perception, a new study says that our brain enlargement and dental reduction did not happen in lockstep.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings suggest that evolution of brain and tooth size in humans were likely influenced by different ecological and behavioural factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Once something becomes conventional wisdom, in no time at all it becomes dogma,&amp;quot; said study co-author Bernard Wood, Professor at George Washington University, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The co-evolution of brains and teeth was on a fast-track to dogma status, but we caught it in the nick of time,&amp;quot; Wood noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This research challenges the common view that reduction of tooth size in hominins is linked with having a larger brain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reasoning is that larger brains allowed hominins to start making stone tools and that the use of these tools reduced the need to have such large chewing teeth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But recent studies by other authors found that hominins had larger brains before chewing teeth became smaller, and they made and used stone tools when brains were still quite small, which challenges this relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new study -- published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- evaluated this issue by measuring and comparing the rates at which teeth and brains have evolved along the different branches of the human evolutionary tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The findings of the study indicate that simple causal relationships between the evolution of brain size, tool use and tooth size are unlikely to hold true when considering the complex scenarios of hominin evolution and the extended time periods during which evolutionary change has occurred,&amp;quot; lead author Aida Gomez-Robles from George Washington University noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the researchers analysed eight different hominin species. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They identified fast-evolving species by comparing differences between groups with those obtained when simulating evolution at a constant rate across all lineages, and they found clear differences between tooth evolution and brain evolution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 3 (IANS) The eggs of non-avian dinosaurs took nearly between three to six months to hatch, similar to crocodiles and lizards, which explains the reason behind the extinction of the dinosaur species, scientists have found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was long assumed that the duration of dinosaur incubation was similar to birds, whose eggs hatch within 11 to 85 days, but they are more like of reptiles whose eggs take weeks to months to hatch.

\&amp;quot;Some of the greatest riddles about dinosaurs pertain to their embryology -- virtually nothing is known. Did their eggs incubate slowly like their reptilian cousins? Or rapidly like living dinosaurs -- the birds,\&amp;quot; asked lead author Gregory Erickson, Professor at Florida State University. 

For the study, the team examined the fossilised teeth of two extremely well-preserved ornithischian dinosaur embryos: Protoceratops -- a pig-sized dinosaur, whose eggs weighed 194 grams -- and Hypacrosaurus -- a very large duck-billed dinosaur, with eggs weighing more than 4-kg.

Analysing the pattern of \&amp;quot;von Ebner\&amp;quot; lines -- the growth lines that are present in the teeth of all animals, as well as humans --, the researchers found that the Protoceratops embryos were about three months old when they died and the Hypacrosaurus embryos were about six months old. 

\&amp;quot;These are the lines that are laid down when any animal\'s teeth develops. They\'re kind of like tree rings, but they are put down daily. And so we could literally count them to see how long each dinosaur had been developing,\&amp;quot; Erickson added.

In addition, the study found that the prolonged incubation may have affected dinosaurs\' ability to compete with more rapidly generating populations of birds, reptiles, and mammals following the mass extinction event that occurred 65 million years ago. 

The long incubation period also exposed the non-avian dinosaur eggs and attending parents to predators, starvation, and environmental disruptions such as flooding, the researchers stated, in the paper published in the journal PNAS.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Jan 3 (IANS) Google dedicated a doodle on Tuesday to mark the 186th birth anniversary of India's 19th century social reformer Savitribai Jyotirao Phule, among the country's first to speak up for the rights of women.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Savitribai K. Patil was born on January 3, 1831, in a rich and influential farming family and at the age of nine was married off to the 13-year old Jyotirao Phule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was taught to read and write by her husband and when she turned 17, the couple founded India's first school for girls and women in Bhidewada, Pune.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It started with just nine girls from different castes enrolled as students - but it became a historic step when female education was considered taboo in the orthodox Indian society prevalent then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Phule couple - who had no children of their own - launched a crusade against social discrimination based on caste and gender, and sparked the flame for women's equal rights during the British rule in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a time when women had no say in anything, Savitribai's campaign covered child marriages, child widows, rape victims becoming pregnant, the practice of 'Sati', educating women and fighting for equal rights for all women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The colourful Doodle shows a simple Savitribai spreading her sari 'pallu' wide to encompass women from all sections of society for education and empowerment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The simple 'Goodle' (Google Doodle) shows a group of demure women assembled outside what could be a school for education in a skyblue starry background which also doubles as her blouse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has a narration by New Delhi-based NGO Zubaan, with colourful paintings by Malvika Asher on the different historical aspects of Savitribai's life starting as a toddler, a child bride, her love for knowledge and learning, opening the first girls school, (1848), and other social institutions, adopting Yeshwant, the son of a Brahmin widow, and honoured by the British government as the Best Teacher in the state in 1852.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It continues onto the death of Jyotirao Phule in 1890, when defying all prevalent social norms, she lit his funeral pyre and carried on the legacy of his Satyashodhak Samaj, and finally her social work during the bubonic plague in Maharashtra which claimed her life in 1897.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Phules had set up 18 more schools across the state of which Savitribai was the teacher, headmistress and principal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly 18 decades later, the Maharashtra government renamed the Pune University as 'Savitribai Phule University' as a tribute to Phule's sheer courage and pioneering efforts in the field of education, women empowerment, social reform and gender equality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since the past few years, several social-political organisations have been demanding that the Phule couple be conferred India's highest civilian honour, Bharat Ratna, which was supported by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qn/in/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 3 (IANS) Apple\'s upcoming iOS 10.3 beta operating system is rumoured to be coming with \'Theater mode\' which will be accessible via a \'popcorn-shaped\' icon in control centre, a media report said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;It is still unclear as to what \'Theater mode\' accomplishes or how it works, however the name suggests a set of device settings suitable for use in a movie theater,\&amp;quot; appleinsider.com reported. 

The recent iOS update was iOS 10.2, launched earlier this month with new emoji characters, tweaks to Music on iPhone and the company\'s new TV app.

The company is also reportedly working on new iPad-specific software features such as improved Apple Pencil support to accompany the hardware updates.

\&amp;quot;Most recently, Apple released the second beta version of iOS 10.2.1 to public testers last week with minor bug fixes and performance improvements,\&amp;quot; the report noted.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Jan 3 (IANS) Facebook courted another controversy after an art historian claimed it blocked a photo of Italy's famous Neptune statue for being &amp;quot;sexually explicit&amp;quot;. The social media giant later termed the censorship a mistake, media reports said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elisa Barbari, a local writer, chose the statue to illustrate her Facebook page, called &amp;quot;Stories, curiosities and views of Bologna&amp;quot;, the Daily Telegraph reported on Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 16th century statue of the sea god dominates Piazza del Nettuno, a grand square in the heart of Bologna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the social media giant objected to the image, which shows a naked Neptune -- Nettuno in Italian -- holding a large trident. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I wanted to promote my page but it seems that for Facebook the statue is a sexually explicit image that shows off too much flesh. Really, Neptune? This is crazy!&amp;quot; Barbari told the Telegraph.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook told her that &amp;quot;the use of the image was not approved because it violates Facebook's guide lines on advertising&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It presents an image with content that is explicitly sexual and which shows to an excessive degree the body, concentrating unnecessarily on body parts. The use of images or video of nude bodies or plunging necklines is not allowed, even if the use is for artistic or educational reasons,&amp;quot; Facebook said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Facebook spokesperson later said in a statement that the censorship was a mistake, the Guardian reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our team processes millions of advertising images each week, and in some instances we incorrectly prohibit ads. This image does not violate our ad policies. We apologise for the error and have let the advertiser know we are approving their ad,&amp;quot; the spokesperson was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past year Facebook found itself in the midst of several controversies for prohibiting seemingly innocuous images, and also for the spread of fake news on the social media platform.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Recently, it was criticised for removing an iconic photograph of a girl fleeing a Napalm attack taken during the Vietnam war. However, Facebook later allowed the photo to be posted on the platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/ap&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 3 (IANS) Barely three months after one of its rockets blew up on the launchpad - destroying a $200 million Facebook satellite with it - SpaceX has said that it plans to try again on January 8.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new launch date was included in a report on Monday that SpaceX released on the explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on September 1, NBC news reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &amp;quot;anomaly&amp;quot; - SpaceX's word - was caused when supercold helium led carbon fibres and aluminium to cool at different rates on the second of the rocket's two stages, the company said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That opened the gaps between two layers of the overwrap, where liquid oxygen escaped and got trapped, it said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That, in turn, caused one of the protective layers to &amp;quot;buckle,&amp;quot; or fail. Static ignited the trapped oxygen, setting off a chain of catastrophic explosions, SpaceX said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Falcon rocket was to have launched an AMOS-6 communications satellite for a Facebook-Eutelsat joint venture to extend Internet access to underserved parts of the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was &amp;quot;deeply disappointed&amp;quot; by the loss but promised that &amp;quot;we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SpaceX, a private space venture run by billionaire inventor Elon Musk, said Monday that its engineers have managed to rejigger the configuration of the rocket's helium containers, moderating the temperature of the helium and presumably eliminating buckling in the overwrap layer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it's successful, the next launch, tentatively schedule for Sunday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, will put 10 satellites into orbit to upgrade and replace some of the units in the Iridium Communications satellite constellation, a system of 66 satellites that provide voice and data coverage around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;in/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Jan 3 (IANS) Google dedicated a Doodle on Tuesday to mark the 186th birth anniversary of India\'s 19th century social reformer Savitribai Jyotirao Phule, considered the first feminist of the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Savitribai K. Patil was born on January 3, 1831, in a rich and influential farming family and at the age of nine was married off to the 13-year old Jyotirao Phule.

She was taught to read and write by her husband and when she turned 17, the couple founded India\'s first school for girls and women in Bhidewada, Pune.

It started with just nine girls from different castes enrolled as students - but it became a historic step when female education was considered taboo in the orthodox Indian society prevalent then.

The Phule couple - who had no children of their own - launched a crusade against social discrimination based on caste and gender, and sparked the flame for women\'s equal rights during the British ruled India.

At a time when women had no say in anything, Savitribai\'s campaign covered child marriages, child widows, rape victims becoming pregnant, the practice of \'Sati\', educating women and fighting for equal rights for all women.

The colourful Doodle shows a simple Savitribai spreading her sari \'pallu\' wide to encompass women from all sections of society for education and empowerment.

The simple \'Goodle\' (Google Doodle) shows a group of demure women assembled outside what could be a school for education in a skyblue starry background which also doubles as her blouse.

Over the next few years, the Phules set up 18 more schools across the state of which Savitribai became the teacher, headmistress and principal.

Nearly 18 decades later, the Maharashtra government renamed the Pune University as \'Savitribai Phule University\' as a tribute to the Phule\'s sheer courage and pioneering efforts in the field of education, women empowerment, social reform and gender equality.

The procedure was very delicate and took a couple of hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussing the procedure, Munzer said: &amp;quot;An electrode is implanted in the inner ear where the child is able to hear sounds for the first time. Gradually, with the help of special software, sounds are adjusted to near normal level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This would eventually help Nafiya hear all the sounds and cope with the communication demands,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharjah TV sponsored the cost of the procedure for the Indian expatriate girl. A cochlear implant costs about $40,840.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Now my daughter can hear us speak. She will listen to music, the birds sing and all the sounds of the world. This is a special day for our family and is one we will never forget,&amp;quot; Nafiya's father was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 2 (IANS) The results of the investigation into what caused Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to catch fire are likely to be released this month, industry sources said on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement is most likely to be made on January 10 or by the end of January at the latest, Yonhap news agency reported citing source with knowledge of the matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The South Korean tech giant asked the US-based safety organisation UL to find the root cause of phablets catching fire. It halted its sales over recurring battery problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Separately, the state-run Korea Testing Laboratory (KTL) also launched its own investigation into components of Samsung's latest flagship phones after numerous reports of the device igniting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the investigation has been separately conducted by the two sides, it is mostly likely for the KTL to announce the final result, the sources said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have not yet confirmed the outcome of UL's investigation,&amp;quot; said a KTL official without further elaborating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government and Samsung reportedly concluded the cause is not a simple battery malfunction, and the two sides are fine-tuning details to reach the final outcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding the exact cause of the Note 7's problem is crucial for Samsung to win back consumers' trust before the firm launches its new flagship model, the Galaxy S8, in April, industry watchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Samsung Electronics must transform itself after learning an expensive lesson last year,&amp;quot; Kwon Oh-hyun, Vice Chairman and CEO of Samsung, said on Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The South Korean government, meanwhile, said it would strengthen its safety measures to prevent a similar problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The government is preparing a revision to safety regulations to prevent a similar accident from occurring,&amp;quot; a government official said on the condition of anonymity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 2 (IANS) As an earlier statement said WhatsApp will stop working on certain phones by the end of 2016, many users of older versions of iPhones and Android handsets are about to find themselves cut off from using the chat app, media has reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WhatsApp, with more than one billion monthly users, had earlier announced that it was phasing out compatibility with older phones in a technology upgrade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in the Independent on Monday, WhatsApp said that the move had been made to ensure that the app could continue to introduce new features and stay secure, which relies on the app being used on newer operating systems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the developing markets where the chat app and older phones are popular, WhatsApp has faced a sharp criticism for its move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WhatsApp had initially listed all BlackBerry models and some Nokia handsets among the handsets that would be blocked from the chat app. However, the company retracted late last year, apparently in response to complaints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are extending support for BlackBerry OS, BlackBerry 10, Nokia S40 and Nokia Symbian S60 until June 30, 2017,&amp;quot; WhatsApp wrote in an update to its blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The service will stop on any first, second, third or fourth generation iPad that has not been updated. Users need to update to iOS 9.3 to use the service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these changes, WhatsApp is expected to more deeply integrate encryption and other privacy services. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Such technology stops messages from being read, and has led to WhatsApp facing criticism from governments who believe that WhatsApp conversations should be made public,&amp;quot; the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/ksk/ap&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Jan 2 (IANS) The exodus of high-profile executives at Twitter continues In China as the company's managing director in the country, Kathy Chen, has quit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Now that the Twitter APAC (Asia-Pacific) team is working directly with Chinese advertisers, this is the right time for me to leave the company,&amp;quot; Chen tweeted. Chen had joined Twitter in April, 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter was not able to legally operate in China due to a government-imposed ban in place. However, the company opened up a Hong Kong office in 2015 to pursue Chinese advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Chen was brought on board to oversee this effort and to find ways for developers and other businesses in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to be able to use the platform,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chen said that since Twitter and Chinese advertisers had developed a relationship, her job was done. She added that the advertiser-base in China had grown nearly 400 per cent over the past two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in the VentureBeat, Chen did not disclose her future plans, except to say in a tweet that she would &amp;quot;take some time off to recharge, study about different cultures and then pursue more international business opportunities.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier, Twitter's Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, Chief Technology Officer Adam Messinger and its vice President for products Josh McFarland also quit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter is going through a major overhaul under CEO Jack Dorsey as many top-notch executives have quit the company in the recent past. Dorsey brought in two board members in a bid to revive the company and earn the trust of investors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter editorial director Karen Wickre and Shariq Rizvi, who co-founded the direct response ads team at Twitter, both announced their departures in 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ksk&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

I find being a mum so rewarding but it can be overwhelming and lonely,&amp;quot; Ljungstrom said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ljungstrom's idea behind sharing the video of her labour was to show the other pregnant women how it went. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She added that she always looked for help and advice especially about the big things like labour and feeding that she was anxious about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ljungstrom later named her newborn daughter Eveline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ksk/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 2 (IANS) Chinese smartphone maker Coolpad has done well with smartphones that are targeted at those who look for devices in the sub-Rs 10,000 category. Continuing the legacy, the company has launched Coolpad Mega 3 that comes with the capability to hold three 4G-ready SIM cards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Rs 6,999, the device is a successor to the Coolpad Mega 2.5D.

Here is what works for the device.

Encased in a plastic exterior, the smartphone has a coarse back cover unlike its predecessor that came with a glossy back which made it difficult to hold in a single hand, given its large size. The phone comes in champagne white, moondust grey and gold white colour variants.

The Mega 3 sports a 5.5-inch IPS HD (1280 x 720 pixel) display which is quite common for devices in this range.

The device is driven by its custom user interface (UI) on top of Android 6.0 Marshmellow and is powered by quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor -- a good combination for a phone at this price range. The device has 2GB RAM and 16GB on-board memory which can be extended up to 32GB.

The phone runs smoothly unless you shuffle between multiple applications, especially during a game.

With a 3,050mAh battery, the Mega 3 can run up to 10-15 hours under moderate use which is fair considering the large screen size.

The 8MP front camera takes good selfies even in low light without using a flash. The 8MP primary camera works fine in outdoor conditions, but in low-light conditions, the quality of photos is not great.

What doesn\'t work?

The device disappoints while playing HD videos as the colours appear dull. Playing heavy games on the device slowed its performance.

Conclusion: Coolpad\'s Mega 3 is for consumers who want a decent performing, selfie-camera phone with a large screen at an affordable price.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 2 (IANS) US President-elect Donald Trump will continue using Twitter with the same gusto he has displayed to date because his tweets get &amp;quot;results&amp;quot;, the mogul's future Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Sunday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EFE news quoted Spicer as telling ABC that the President-elect did not need to have his comments filtered through the &amp;quot;mainstream media&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You know, with all due respect, I think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over 45-plus million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation. He doesn't have to have it funnelled through the media,&amp;quot; Spicer said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump's Twitter account, specifically, has more than 18 million followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The future Press Secretary's remarks contrast with those of Trump himself in his first interview after winning the November 8 election, when he said that he would limit his use of Twitter and promised, instead of using it, to comport himself in a more prudent manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I'm going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to be very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication,&amp;quot; he said at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the real-estate magnate has not appeared to curtail his tweets and in December remarked on the social network that the United States should &amp;quot;strengthen and expand&amp;quot; its nuclear capacity until &amp;quot;the world comes to its senses regarding nukes&amp;quot;, a comment that drew much criticism because of fears that such a course of action would spark a nuclear arms race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also tweeted about the UN that &amp;quot;the United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His UN comment came after the Security Council on December 23 decided to demand that Israel stop establishing settlements on Palestinian territory, a decision the US allowed by refusing to veto it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Singapore, Jan 1 (IANS) The threat of breaching the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags that help automated identification of your mobile phone, passport, credit cards, access passes and others could soon be mitigated, thanks to the new security features researchers are developing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To better safeguard the everyday technologies of RFID, researchers in Singapore are designing and testing new RFID protocols with enhanced security features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A security breach in RFID applications would leak valuable information about physical objects to unauthorised parties,&amp;quot; Li Yingjiu, Associate Professor at Singapore Management University said in an official statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many industries, like pharmaceutical companies, use the RFID technology to track inventory and manage supply chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Because RFID tags work by broadcasting information to electronic RFID readers, security breaches can occur if hackers eavesdrop on this conversation, and manage to gain access to or tamper with information,&amp;quot; the study noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers say that such an attack, in the context of supply chain management, for example, would mean industrial espionage and the hacker may obtain sensitive information about inventory levels, trading volumes, trading partners and even business plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To tackle such a potential threat, researchers are employing strategies that include making the protocol's output unpredictable, making two tags indistinguishable to the hacker and preventing them from obtaining useful information even if they manage to interact with the tags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In addition, there are many instances where sharing of RFID information -- between suppliers and retailers, for example, or between various components of an Internet of Things -- would have obvious benefits,&amp;quot; noted Li.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But without appropriate security controls, however, most companies would be reluctant to make valuable data readily available,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers are also designing improved access control mechanisms that protect RFID information when it is shared on the internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers said that one of the data security field's biggest challenges is the widening gap between academia and industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The future of data security, in my vision, is how to narrow the gap and bridge the two communities, which have completely different incentives and evaluation criteria,&amp;quot;  Li said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Li and his recently reported Android framework vulnerabilities and potential attacks to Google who acknowledged its findings in its security bulletins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, to give data owners a better control over who can access their data, the researchers are working to develop new solutions for attribute-based encryption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Jan 1 (IANS) A &amp;quot;fire to fight fire&amp;quot; treatment billed as a potential breakthrough in the fight against disease, including cancer, could back-fire and make the disease more damaging in some circumstances, a new research has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It showed that introducing 'friendlier' less-potent strains into a bunch of disease-causing microbes can lead to increased disease severity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our study shows that a promising disease management strategy may not always be effective and indeed may have damaging unforeseen consequences,&amp;quot; said lead researcher Ivana Gudelj, Professor at Exeter University in Britain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research showed that far from being a &amp;quot;silver bullet&amp;quot; to weaken disease, the practice of introducing pacifist microbes into a host could make the aggressive pathogen stronger, which could hamper disease management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until now, introducing friendlier cousins, which do not cause severe disease, into a population of pathogens has been shown to reduce disease severity and damage to the infected host.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been suggested that this approach could be an effective way of treating cancer, and research so far has proved effective and promising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, scientists have already produced encouraging results in the fight against Clostridium difficile infections that are so common in our hospitals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, the scientists tested this strategy using a plant pathogen, and found the therapy could go dramatically wrong, with devastating consequences for the host plant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team investigated the devastating rice blast disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They introduced a mixed population of the fungus that causes this disease into rice, where the mixture included an aggressive strain and a pacifist mutant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They expected that the overall disease severity would decrease because of the presence of the pacifist strain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, they found the opposite. The rice plants succumbed to much more severe disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, published in the journal eLife, showed that the therapy can in some circumstances have the opposite effect, and that the way the pathogen would behave can be unpredictable, leading to more severe disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research highlights the need for these new strategies to be carefully tested before they are used therapeutically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scientists used cooperation theory and mathematical modelling to identify the reason for their surprising result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They found that in some circumstances pacifists &amp;quot;helped&amp;quot; aggressive microbes to be more efficient in utilising resources obtained from the host.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We find that the mechanisms driving our unexpected findings when treating rice blast infection are pertinent for many diseases involving bacterial and fungal pathogens,&amp;quot;  Gudelj noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 1 (IANS) A gene mutation linked to Alzheimer's disease and other age-related cognitive declines in our relatively safe and sterile post-industrial setting might have actually helped protect us from cognitive decline in ancient times, a new research suggests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings suggest that a genetic mutation (or allele) that puts populations at risk for illnesses in one environmental setting could manifest itself in positive ways in a different setting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It seems that some of the very genetic mutations that help us succeed in more hazardous time periods and environments may actually become mismatched in our relatively safe and sterile post-industrial lifestyles,&amp;quot; said lead author Ben Trumble, Assistant Professor at the Arizona State University in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a paper published in The FASEB Journal, the researchers examined how the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene might function differently in an infectious environment than in the urban industrialised settings where ApoE has mostly been examined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All ApoE proteins help mediate cholesterol metabolism, and assist in the crucial activity of transporting fatty acids to the brain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in industrialised societies, ApoE4 variant carriers also face up to a four-fold higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and other age-related cognitive declines, as well as a higher risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal of this study was to reexamine the potentially detrimental effects of the globally-present ApoE4 allele in environmental conditions more typical of those experienced throughout our species' existence -- in this case, a community of Amazonian forager-horticulturalists called the Tsimane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For 99 per cent of human evolution, we lived as hunter gatherers in small bands and the last 5,000-10,000 years -- with plant and animal domestication and sedentary urban industrial life -- is completely novel,&amp;quot; Trumble said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the tropical environment and a lack of sanitation, running water, or electricity, remote populations like the Tsimane face high exposure to parasites and pathogens, which cause their own damage to cognitive abilities when untreated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, one might expect Tsimane ApoE4 carriers who also have a high parasite burden to experience faster and more severe mental decline in the presence of both these genetic and environmental risk factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But researchers discovered the exact opposite when they tested these individuals using a seven-part cognitive assessment and a medical exam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, Tsimane who both carried ApoE4 and had a high parasitic burden displayed steadier or even improved cognitive function in the assessment versus non-carriers with a similar level of parasitic exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This indicated that the allele potentially played a role in maintaining cognitive function even when exposed to environmental-based health threats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 1 (IANS/Yonhap) North Korea is in the final stages of preparing to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the country's leader said on Sunday in the latest sign that Pyongyang will not abandon its nuclear and missile programmes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We were actively engaged in research and development of advanced weapons... The develpoment of long-range missiles is in final stages,&amp;quot; Kim Jong-Un said in a televised New Year's message broadcast by the state-run TV station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His remarks come amid growing speculation that North Korea may carry out more powerful provocations around its key anniversaries this year as it pumps up efforts to make miniaturised and diversified nuclear weapons with the goal of developing a nuclear-tipped ICBM which can fly as far as the US mainland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim, in his speech, said that North Korea soared as a nuclear and military power boosted by the success of the country's two nuclear tests last year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The North Korean leader vowed to develop more weapons to boost its strike capabilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim also threatened that Pyongyang will beef up its readiness to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes if the United States and South Korea do not suspend their annual joint military exercises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;(If they do not stop nuclear threats), North Korea will keep increasing the military capabilities for self-defence and pre-emptive striking capacity with a main emphasis on nuclear force,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Pyongyang, the year 2017 is &amp;quot;an opportune time,&amp;quot; as it believes that Seoul and Washington will not be able to take physical or military actions to deter its nuclear aspirations due to their internal political situation, said Thae, a former top North Korean diplomat who defected to the South last July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 1 (IANS) While many new entrants in the smartphone space make their debut in the sub-Rs 10,000 category to target the masses, domestic player Smartron is targeting the mid-range segment with its t.phone that comes with \&amp;quot;tron.x\&amp;quot; eco-system, enabling users access to various services from Smartron.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Built on the world of \&amp;quot;Internet of Trons\&amp;quot;, the tron.x eco-system allows instant access to your profile, data, content, services, Cloud, care, community and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices whether you are at home or in a car on the go or at office or in the field.

The tron.x eco-system offers t.cloud, t.store and t.care. Once enabled, t.cloud automatically backs up and allows you to access your data seamlessly from any Smartron device.

t.store offers an e-showcase of all Smartron device accessories, allowing you to get it delivered at your doorstep with a single click.

The company\'s 24/7 customer service, known as t.care, offers remote diagnostics and ensures you an uninterrupted experience.

Priced at Rs 24,999, the company has put high-end specifications into the phone and competes with the likes of the Chinese-made Xiaomi Mi 5 and OnePlus 3.

Here is what works for the device.

The t.phone sports a dual-tone colour scheme and comes in classic grey, metallic pink, steel blue and sunrise orange -- all of which look distinct. The review unit we received came in sunrise orange which looked a bit flashy.

The 5.5-inch, full-HD Super-AMOLED display with 401ppi produced vibrant images on the screen with good contrast and has good outdoor visibility.

Being a Super-AMOLED display, t.phone has higher colour gamut and images are vivid, clear and sharper than Xiaomi Mi 5, thus watching movies and videos is pleasant on the device.

The device is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that was in the news for heating problems. However, we did not face any such issues during charging or while working on the device for longer hours.

The company has not customised the user interface and, running on Marshmallow, the t.phone delivers stock Android experience.

Although not the best camera in this price segment, t.phone captures decent quality images, but at times misses out details. The 16MP rear camera of the Xiaomi Mi 5 captured more colour and detailed shots than t.phone.

The speaker at the bottom with DTS premium and DTS PlayFi produces good sound. The smartphone incorporates four mics which will also help users who regularly listen to recordings for future use as the playback is clear. 

The 64GB onboard storage gives enough room to store your multimedia content. Coupled with t.cloud, the device offers unlimited storage; thus there will always be space for a precious moment without having the need to delete your data.

What does not work?

With a mid-range price tag, there is no fingerprint sensor when smartphones in the sub-Rs 10,000 range integrate one.

Conclusion: For a homegrown player and at Rs 24,999, the Smartron t.phone packs both style and substance and has specifications that performs well.

It will also empower the local communities to get involved in their children's education,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SMIS will be the largest e-governance initiative in J&amp;K with a huge base of stakeholders involving 33% of total employees of the state and around 26 lakh students,&amp;quot; the minister said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SMIS provides readily available digital details of all the 28,000 schools in the state, their location, type of school, number of classrooms, toilets, library, science labs, boundary wall, number of teachers, number of students, teacher-student ratio,&amp;quot; Akhtar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SMIS will help in scientific rationalisation of staff and space in schools, helping deployment of subject and qualification wise teachers. It also keep track of the academic performance of the schools, students, enrolment and dropout rate,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The minister said given its large school system spread across length and breadth of the state the absence of a reliable database had resulted in poor decision-making, lack of transparency and accountability, uneven infrastructure and non-reliable teacher and student records, which compromise the larger goal of quality education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sq/pgh/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 31 (IANS) The rapid rise in the atmospheres oxygen roughly 500 million years ago which made advanced animal life possible on Earth is linked to the process that led to the formation of fossil fuels, suggests new research.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rise in oxygen was associated with a rapid increase in the burial of sediment containing large amounts of carbon-rich organic matter - the raw material of coal, oil and natural gas, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Burying the sediments that became fossil fuels was the key to advanced animal life on Earth,&amp;quot; said study co-author Shanan Peters, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Multicellular life is largely a creation of the &amp;quot;Cambrian explosion,&amp;quot; which coincided with a spike in atmospheric oxygen roughly 500 million years ago, Peters pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was during the Cambrian explosion that most of the animals appeared and evolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In green plants, photosynthesis separates carbon dioxide into molecular oxygen (which is released to the atmosphere), and carbon (which is stored in carbohydrates).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But photosynthesis had already been around for at least 2.5 billion years. So what accounted for the sudden spike in oxygen during the Cambrian?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published online in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, linked the rise in oxygen to a rapid increase in the burial of sediment containing large amounts of carbon-rich organic matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key is to recognise that sediment storage blocks the oxidation of carbon, Peters said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without burial, this oxidation reaction causes dead plant material on Earth's surface to burn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That causes the carbon it contains, which originated in the atmosphere, to bond with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. And for oxygen to build up in our atmosphere, plant organic matter must be protected from oxidation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that is exactly what happens when organic matter -- the raw material of coal, oil and natural gas -- is buried through geologic processes, the researchers explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers warned that today, burning billions of tonnes of stored carbon in fossil fuels is removing large amounts of oxygen from the atmosphere, reversing the pattern that drove the rise in oxygen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so the oxygen level in the atmosphere falls as the concentration of carbon dioxide rises, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 31 (IANS) A family in the US who lost their young daughter in a car crash recently filed a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly encouraging distracted driving through &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; video calling app, media reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; while driving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; or give strong warning about using the app while driving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a �driver handheld computing device lock-out,&amp;quot; the family said in the complaint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Chennai, Dec 31 (IANS) The trial run of India's first 700 MW pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) coming up at Kakrapar is expected to take place sometime in mid-2017, said a senior official of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India's atomic power plant operator NPCIL is building four 700 MW PHWRs -- two each at Kakrapar Atomic Power Station (KAPS) in Gujarat and Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) in Rajasthan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The construction of two 700 MW PHWRs at KAPS is at an advanced stage. The commissioning activities of the first unit has begun. The trial run of the first unit is expected to happen sometime during the middle of next year,&amp;quot; B.C.Pathak, Executive Director (Projects), told IANS here over phone from Mumbai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking to IANS, Vineet Kumar, Station Director of the two units (3 and 4 at KAPS) said: &amp;quot;We have started the commissioning activities. It will be done in stages and various milestones have to be crossed.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We will be doing the hydro test first in May-June 2017. The next step will be hot conditioning of the unit, which would happen around two-and-a-half months after the hydro test,&amp;quot; Kumar added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After that the systems have to be drained and dried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The fuel loading is expected to happen in October 2017 and the reactor's criticality (first time starting of the nuclear fission process) is slated to happen in November 2017,&amp;quot; Kumar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Kumar, the unit is expected to start commercial operations early 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the status of the other 700 MW unit Pathak said the 4th unit at KAPS would start 6-7 months after the third unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project cost for the two 700 MW units is around Rs 11,500 crore, Kumar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For NPCIL that has been building 220 MW and 540 MW pressurised heavy water reactors, it is a major jump to go in for 700 MW PHWRs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concrete was first poured in November 2010 for the 3rd unit at KAPS and in March 2011 for the fourth unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Pathak work at the 7th and 8th units (700 MW) at RAPS are also progressing well with the erection of major components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two project sites are humming with activity and the project schedule is being compressed to complete it at the earliest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vj/ksk/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>
