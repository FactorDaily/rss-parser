<content><![CDATA[ <p>Yokohama (Japan), Dec 16 (IANS) Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has said that the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system being used at the ongoing Club World Cup here causes confusion, though he acknowledged that he has to adapt to whatever FIFA wants to do.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The former France star made his remarks in a press conference on Thursday following Real Madrid's 2-0 victory over Club America in the semi-finals, while the VAR system validated the second goal of the Spanish team, reports Efe news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I have my ideas and with the second goal there was a little confusion, it's true,&amp;quot; the manager said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The problem is that we have to adapt to what FIFA wants to do,&amp;quot; Zidane explained, according to the Spanish club's official website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The controversial VAR system was used twice in the tournament -- to validate Real Madrid's second goal on Thursday and to award a penalty on Wednesday to Kashima Antlers, who also advanced to Sunday's final.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If it improves things it will improve football, but things need to be clearer,&amp;quot; Zidane added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Dec 16 (IANS) Chinese yuan weakened against the US dollar on Friday for the third-straight day Friday after the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) raised the benchmark interest rate for the first time this year, Xinhua news agency reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yuan, which recently become one of the five global reserve currencies, dropped to an 8-year low against the US dollar on Thursday. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;The yuan has steadily weakened against the US dollar since the start of the year, sending shock waves through currency markets. Financial experts have weighed in to point out that the depreciation is, in essence, a self-correction, and the yuan will continue to remain stable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The central parity rate of the Chinese currency weakened 219 basis points to 6.9508 against the US dollar Friday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trading System.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     The Federal Reserve Wednesday raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, the first and only time in 2016, and hinted there would be three increases in 2017, more than investors were positioned for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     Analysts have said that with a rate-hike largely priced in before Wednesday, the greenback was supported by the speculation of more rate-hikes next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Looking ahead, the yuan may come under short-term pressure but have limited room for further weakening, analysts agreed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     They also ruled out the possibility of substantial depreciation in the longer term as China continues to witness steady economic growth, progress in economic restructuring and a stable financial market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     In China's spot foreign exchange market, the yuan is allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     The central parity rate of the yuan against the US dollar is based on a weighted average of prices offered by market makers before the opening of the interbank market each business day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gsh/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 16 (IANS) In a first, an Indian-American woman has been elected the new mayor of Californian city Cupertino, the worldwide headquarters of Apple, it was reported on Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Savita Vaidhyanathan, a Cupertino resident for more than 20 years, was sworn in last week in a ceremony attended by her mother who had flown in from India, the Mercury News reported. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I've had several congratulatory messages saying that I'm the first woman mayor of Indian-origin. Yes, I do take a lot of pride and prestige in that,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I do want to thank the residents of the city of Cupertino that voted me in not looking at ethnicity at all. Thank you for your trust in me, and maybe we did break that silicon ceiling and put a few more cracks in that glass ceiling,&amp;quot; Vaidhyanathan added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She takes over from Barry Chang who had served as mayor from 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaidhyanathan was working as a high school Maths teacher and an officer in a commercial bank.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/ahm/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) Urban Development Minister M. Venkaiah Naidu on Friday said the opposition appeared to be &amp;quot;fighting for the corrupt and terrorists&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Earlier, when the opposition used to raise its voice against corruption, the ruling party used to suppress the voice,&amp;quot; Naidu told the media. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But today some of the opposition parties are blocking the government's action and it appears they are fighting for the corrupt, black money holders and terrorists,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Defining demonetisation as a historic and bold step, Naidu said: &amp;quot;This decision of the Prime Minister is aimed at attacking those forces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;One can find faults in the implementation, they can give suggestions, but how can you find faults in the decision of the government?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is a historic, radical and bold decision taken by the Prime Minister. It is a fight against black money and corruption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The irony is to see the government fighting corruption and black money, and the opposition rallying behind the corrupt forces,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is all because he has attacked the roots of corruption and black money,&amp;quot; Naidu said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government on November 8 scrapped Rs 500 and 1,000 notes, saying the decision was meant to fight black money, corruption and terror funding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The roots and the foundation stone of black money and corruption have been shaken. That's why they are ... trying to create panic among the people.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naidu's remarks came after the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were adjourned again on the last day of the winter session. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naidu also targeted the opposition for supporting the Congress over demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is tragic that the opposition parties which fought against the Congress earlier ... are ready to accept the leadership of the Congress,&amp;quot; Naidu said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is laughable and most unfortunate for democracy.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;aks/py/in/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 16 (IANS) Actor Nikitin Dheer, whose character of Astika has been killed in TV show &amp;quot;Nagarjun - Ek Yoddha&amp;quot;, says the emotional farewell party that the cast and crew threw for him made him realise the bonds he has developed for a lifetime on the set.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His character has been killed as the show nears its end. The Life OK show will be wrapped up by mid-January 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of the farewell party, Nikitin said: &amp;quot;Some good memories were relived.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding his role coming to an end, he said: &amp;quot;My journey as Astika comes to an emotional end. I was very fortunate to meet some wonderful souls, connections I shall remember for a lifetime, love I shall cherish forever. When I left, I saw some people in tears and it just made me feel that what we do is just not make belief, it's real on many levels.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actor, who was also seen sharing screen space with superstar Shah Rukh Khan in &amp;quot;Chennai Express&amp;quot;, also thanked the cast and crew for giving him &amp;quot;so much love and to the audience for appreciating&amp;quot; his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actress Kratika Sengar, Nikitin's wife, was also present at the party.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She posted a photograph from the gathering on social media, saying: &amp;quot;Some old, some new, some for lifetime, some as fresh as dew... Had a great time with 'Nagarjun' team.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-*-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Drashti Dhami misplaced her wedding ring&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actress Drashti Dhami, who is currently seen as Naina in &amp;quot;Pardes Mein Hai Mera Dil&amp;quot;, misplaced her wedding ring on the set of the popular TV show. However, she found it back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It happened when Drashti was shooting for a marriage sequence and was dressed in bridal wear. Wearing her own wedding ring as a part of the track, Drashti was shooting for the scene with actor Arjun Bijlani.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We were playing 'find the ring' ceremony as a part of the post-wedding ritual when Drashti mentioned that she could not find her real wedding ring. We thought she would be joking about it and laughed it off,&amp;quot; Arjun said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Drashti later found her ring in her vanity van.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I realised I had taken it off while the make-up lady was filling up my mehendi design to avoid stain. I forgot it in the vanity itself. I am so happy it was not lost,&amp;quot; Drashti said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-*-&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;�Ishqbaaaz' stars visit set by jetty to avoid traffic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actors Nakuul Mehta, Kunal Jaisingh and Leenesh Mattoo, who are currently seen as brothers in &amp;quot;Ishqbaaaz&amp;quot;, took a jetty ride to reach on the set of the popular TV show in order to avoid traffic on road.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trio had to shoot for an upcoming high point on the show for which, the set up had been put up in the Madh Island area here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to avoid the traffic, Nakuul, Kunal and Leenesh decided to reach set through jetty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The jetty is an extremely fun and more convenient way to travel given the traffic in Mumbai at peak hours in the morning,&amp;quot; Kunal said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Instead of spending two hours in the car, it was more convenient for us to spend only 20 minutes to travel from Versova to Madh by the jetty. And with the slight chills in Mumbai, the cool winds hitting our faces too was an experience in its itself,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Ishqbaaaz&amp;quot; airs on Star Plus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dc-sas/rb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The Rajya Sabha was on Friday adjourned sine die after an emotional speech by Chairman Hamid Ansari, who voiced anguish over disruptions of the house during the entire winter session.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The 241st session that commenced on November 16 comes to a close today,&amp;quot; Ansari told the members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I had fervently hoped that I would not have to repeat what I said at the conclusion of the 221st session in December 2013. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;My hope stands belied. Regular and continuous disruptions characterized the session. The symbolism of dignified protest so essential for orderly conduct of parliamentary proceedings was abandoned,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ansari held both the treasury and opposition benches responsible for the bedlam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Regular and continuous disruptions signify this session... The rules about displaying placards and shouting slogans were ignored by all sections of the house,&amp;quot; Ansari said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This deprived members of the opportunity to seek accountability of the executive through questions and discussions on matters of public interest.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He, however, mentioned there was a useful discussion on demonetisation on November 16 and 24 but it remained inconclusive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The house also passed the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sk/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Rionegro (Colombia), Dec 16 (IANS) Chapecoense defender Helio Zampier Neto, one of the six survivors of the air accident in which 71 people died, has left the hospital near Medellin where he had been recovering and returned to Brazil in &amp;quot;good shape&amp;quot; and expressing gratitude to Colombia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The specialised air-medical transport plane on which Neto traveled with his wife, Simone, a doctor, a nurse and two pilots, along with a medical team to attend to any emergency, took off from Jose Maria Cordova airport here on Thursday, reports Efe news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Francisco Souto, the head of the medical mission, supervised Neto's boarding the plane and said that &amp;quot;he is conscious, oriented and he's a little afraid, as is natural.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before being loaded into the aircraft on a gurney, Neto bade farewell to the medical director at the San Vicente Fundacion Rionegro Hospital, Dr. Ferney Rodriguez, and the personnel who transported him and his father, Helan Zampier, who said goodbye to his son wearing a Chapecoense jersey with No.29 on the back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The plane transporting Neto, the last survivor to be rescued from the crash site of the plane operated by Bolivia's Lamia Airline, is scheduled to make a stop in Manaus and later to complete the five-hour flight to Chapeco.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We're hoping for a very calm flight. Neto is OK. The CAT scan didn't show any hemothorax (blood in the space surrounding the lungs) and he's finishing the antibiotics phase,&amp;quot; Edson Stakonski, Chapeco's cardiologist, told reporters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stakonski, the head of the Unimed Chapeco Hospital, where Neto will continue to recover after the November 28 crash, said he felt &amp;quot;calmer&amp;quot; before boarding the plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I'm calmer. The four (Brazilian survivors) have returned, the mission is completed. Since I arrived (in Rionegro), I've focused a lot on the clinical and we had enormous support from the doctors here,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rodriguez said that Neto had been in &amp;quot;very critical&amp;quot; condition after the crash, but &amp;quot;thanks to his physical strength, he improved and ... we could transfer him much sooner (than expected). This wasn't in the plans; we were thinking that his recovery was going to take many days.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before leaving Colombia, Neto sent a videotaped message released by the Jose Maria Cordova airport, saying: &amp;quot;I want to thank everyone for their help and congratulate them for their marvelous work.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neto will continue recovering from a lung infection in Chapeco, where his physical and psychological progress will be carefully monitored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) With nearly 250 million unique smartphone users in the country and the figure set to reach the 280 million-mark by the end of this year, the Indian smartphone industry -- that surpassed the US to become the world's second-largest market by users in 2016 -- is set to break new records.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a year of several firsts -- the first modular smartphone G5 from South Korean giant LG and TCL 560 that came equipped with a unique eye-verification feature from Chinese electronics brand TCL Corporation to the delight of Indian users -- leading smartphone makers clearly zeroed in on flagship devices packed with features never heard of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;South Korean smartphone maker Samsung was the first to launch its flagship smartphone Galaxy S7 and its curved-screen companion Galaxy S7 Edge in March at irresistible prices of Rs 48,900 and Rs 56,900, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The smartphones came with innovations in design, imaging, software functionality and connectivity with a host of other services. The company also introduced the first dual-pixel camera on Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In March, tech giant Apple stunned its rivals by launching a cheaper, smaller yet powerful iPhone SE. Regarded as the cheapest iPhone model so far, the phone came in two variants -- 16GB and 64GB.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taiwan-based HTC also unveiled its flagship HTC 10 in May that competes with the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge and iPhone 6s/6s Plus. It offered great multi-tasking abilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the world of technology was going ga-ga over the future of modular smartphones, LG translated the concept into reality with the G5 -- its flagship device that upped the ante for other vendors in the customised smartphone market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rs 52,990 G5 features a &amp;quot;slide-out&amp;quot; battery design and dual rear cameras -- the only device to feature dual primary cameras which work independent of each other.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus in June launched its flagship all-rounder OnePlus 3, with 6GB RAM and a unique dash-charge feature that gives 60 per cent of battery life in flat 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;July marked the entry of game-changer TCL 560 smartphone by TCL Corporation and is the only device sub-8K that comes with iris-based &amp;quot;EyeVerify&amp;quot; unlock feature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ending round-the-clock rumours, the Cupertino-giant Apple in September unveiled its much-anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, along with next-generation 'Apple Watch Series 2'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iPhone 7 features breakthrough new camera systems, the best battery life ever in an iPhone and water and dust resistance. The device also has a dual-core processor with GPU that is up to two times faster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set to counter Apple's iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri, Google came with Pixel in October -- the first phone made by Google with the Google Assistant built right in, bringing together the best of Google's software and world-class hardware.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other Chinese brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo also kept the momentum going by bringing high-end specifications in flagship devices. Domestic players such as Micromax and Karbonn also introduced their share of devices in the sub-10K category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2016, users also witnessed many new devices with virtual reality (VR) capabilities, improved optics, powerful processors and longer battery back-up. Smartphones with heavy-duty front cameras (remember Vivo V5?) also arrived every now and then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another highlight of the year was &amp;quot;Make in India&amp;quot; announcements from smartphone makers like global internet technology conglomerate LeEco -- a new entrant in India that created quite a ripple with its popular range of &amp;quot;Superphones&amp;quot; like Le 1s Eco, Le 2 and Le Max 2. Other such manufacturing announcements/commitments came from Micromax, Vivo India, Huawei and LG, among others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Highlights of the Indian smartphone industry in 2016:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* India overtook the US to become the world's second-largest smartphone market by users&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The country touched nearly 250 million unique smartphone users and the figure was set to reach the 280 million-mark by the end of the year&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Several smartphone makers announced they would start manufacturing in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* The smartphone market in India crossed the 30 million unit shipments milestone for the first time ever in a quarter in third quarter of 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Anuj Sharma can be contacted at anuj.s@ians.in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/vm/ky/sac/tb&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York/Bengaluru, Dec 16 (IANS) To attract new users to the platform, micro-blogging website Twitter developed a standalone instant messaging app in India for emerging markets but killed the product without launching it as the company shut down its Bengaluru engineering centre that developed it, a media report claimed on Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Buzzfeed, the stand-alone app -- for which Twitter spent more than a year developing it -- was intended to be an on-ramp for new users to Twitter proper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app was built at Twitter's Indian engineering centre in Bengaluru and blended tweets and instant messages in a single interface. But the company killed it in September this year when it shut down its India engineering centre, the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter intended to identify &amp;quot;influencers&amp;quot; around certain topics -- let's say news or politics or sports and encourage them to create groups of interest within the app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter users could chat among themselves on the app and they could also subscribe to relevant Twitter accounts whose tweets would be pulled in automatically into these groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Twitter did not have that many active users in India, so the idea was that if enough people used the instant messaging app, we could expose a lot of people to tweets without them even going to Twitter in the first place,&amp;quot; Buzzfeed reported, quoting a source as saying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Eventually, we hoped they would see the value of signing up for Twitter and directly following as many people as they wanted,&amp;quot; it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A project lead in Twitter's Bengaluru office, who oversaw the instant messaging project, reportedly decided to shut the project since the versions of the app that Twitter tested out with users anonymously did not get good feedback. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It did not test out so well in the market surveys that we did with college students and I think that was one of the reasons why Twitter decided to shelve it,&amp;quot; the rpeort added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Less than a week after the company announced its global layoffs at the end of October, Twitter India head, Rishi Jaitley, quit after a four-year stint. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just a couple of days later, Parminder Singh, Twitter's managing director for Southeast Asia, resigned too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sku/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The actual loss may be less after survey,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, private sector Royal Sundaram General Insurance Co has received around 120 claims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But the quantum of damage is not yet known,&amp;quot; Nikhil Apte, Chief Product Officer at Royal Sundaram, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Apte, the number of claims from holders of home insurance was very small.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apte urged policy holders to inform the insurer first and wait for loss assessor's arrival before carrying out any repair work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to an industry official, after last year's floods in Chennai that resulted in a loss of around Rs 4,800 crore, reinsurers not only increased the premium for the catastrophic loss insurance but also doubled the deductible to Rs 50 crore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deductible is the sum reinsurers would not pay and the primary insurers have to bear themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So claims up to Rs 50 crore have to be borne by us,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to him, any loss caused by a major natural disaster was classified as catastrophic loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vj/in/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) It was the year of the big bang in telecom. Reliance Jio\'s disruptive entry into the sector threw an unorthodox gauntlet at its rivals, triggering a bruising war of words -- and tariffs -- among players.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it was also the year which ended in a whimper for the telecom spectrum auction. The much-touted \&amp;quot;biggest spectrum auction\&amp;quot; proved to be a stupendous failure, marring the spirit of the industry.

Reliance Jio launched its fourth generation (4G) services in September -- offering free voice, forever. To sweeten the deal, it threw in free data till the end of the year, later extending it to March of 2017.

Voice is what telecom operators make their money on. Without that, how does one survive in a market as price sensitive as India?

\&amp;quot;I assure you, we will not lose money,\&amp;quot; Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani told his shareholders while announcing the Jio offer. This was taking competition to a whole new level.

\&amp;quot;The free voice call offer by Reliance for the 4G roll-out was a major event -- it was disruptive,\&amp;quot; Rishi Tejpal, Principal Research Analyst for Telecom Business Strategy at Gartner, told IANS.

Jio\'s disruptive offer led to long queues at its outlets across the country. But then in mobile telephony, each network is dependent on the others for succesful completion of pan-Indian calls. Reliance Jio found a new turf war in the making. It accused incumbent players of not providing enough number of Points of Interconnection (PoIs).

As expected, the matter was dragged to the ministry level and the watchdog -- the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The regulator proposed a heavy penalty of Rs 3,050 crore, in all, on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular for \&amp;quot;violating licence norms\&amp;quot; by denying enough PoIs to Reliance Jio.

\&amp;quot;The issue of limited interconnection points, as highlighted by Reliance Jio, impacted the customer experience it wanted to give its customers,\&amp;quot; Tejpal said.

The gauntlet thrown by Reliance Jio was, of course, picked up -- there was no way out. The three big telecom players in the country -- Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular -- brought in their own offers on free calls for pre-paid customers.

\&amp;quot;The incumbents seem not to have lost comparable market share or seen a large movement of their customers to Jio,\&amp;quot; Mahesh Uppal, Director of consultancy firm Com First, told IANS

Losing market share is one thing; losing revenue is another and a more serious matter. \&amp;quot;There is sufficient evidence that attempts by incumbent mobile operators to match Jio\'s aggressive pricing has dented their revenues significantly,\&amp;quot; Uppal adds.

The situation, therefore, would be a matter of concern for both sides, he suggests. The new year would decide who gets a bloody nose and who remains unscathed in this bruising fight.

By the end of September, the number of wireless telephone subscribers in India had already crossed the one billion mark, standing at 1,049 million, according to TRAI data.

Amidst the unhappiness over call drops and poor service -- often attributed to lack of enough telecom towers or adequate spectrum, the government was very hopeful that its \&amp;quot;biggest spectrum auction\&amp;quot; would bring in substantial revenue and ease the problems.

The big hope was to raise Rs 566,000 crore. It got commitments of only Rs 65,789 crore or 11.6 per cent of the desired figure, with the auction ending within five days.

The government was warned by experts and the industry that the high reserve price the regulator chose -- and approved by the Central government -- would not excite telecom operators. But the government\'s sight was set on garnering revenue.

A total 2,354 MHz of spectrum was put on the block for e-auctioning, but only 965 MHz was sold -- or just 41 per cent of what was on offer. The auction went through 31 rounds for seven bands -- 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz, 2,100 MHz, 2,300 MHz and 2,500 MHz. There were no takers for 700 MHz and 900 MHz -- as cautioned.

\&amp;quot;The spectrum auctions have successfully removed the long-felt shortage for spectrum but failed to deliver the revenues that the exchequer had hoped to receive. They reflect that companies do not find the powerful 700 MHz sufficiently attractive at the price the government expected. The government will now need to review its plans for future auctions,\&amp;quot; said Uppal.

Industry experts, though, say the service quality would improve with whatever was sold, replenishing or adding to the kitty of the telecom players.

The operators also moved to tackle the call-drop issue by planning to set up 60,000 telecom towers at a cost of Rs 12,000 crore.

\&amp;quot;The industry has made consistent and significant efforts to optimise networks which have largely been completed, with more than 200,000 sites being installed in the last 15 months for 2G and 3G services across the country since Jan 1, 2015,\&amp;quot; Rajan S. Mathews, Director General, Cellular Operators\' Association of India (COAI), told IANS.

Highlights of telecom industry in 2016:

* Launch of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September

* Spectrum auction: Ended within five days with a total commitment of only Rs 65,789 crore

* Reliance Communications and Aircel merger that resulted in asset base of Rs 65,000 crore

* Reliance Jio, Reliance Communications got government\'s nod for spectrum sharing

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The Lok Sabha on Friday took up the Rights of  Persons with Disabilities Bill for consideration and passing during zero hour as most of the Opposition left to meet President Pranab Mukherjee.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rajya Sabha on Wednesday had passed, by voice vote, the bill which expands the list of disabilities from 7 to 19, and makes accessibility to public buildings, transport, polling station a mandatory requirement and provides for a national fund for welfare of the disabled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bill, which replaces the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, has been brought in to comply with the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which India signed in 2007.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were disruptions in the house as it was adjourned till noon on the last day of winter session, as opposition demanded a discussion on demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As soon as the house met, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge was on his feet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We were ready for the discussion yesterday (Thursday), but the Parliamentary Affairs Minister (Ananth Kumar) made reckless charges against us,&amp;quot; Kharge said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, however, said that the issue could be raised at 12 noon and tried to proceed with the question hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Opposition members then trooped near the Speaker's podium shouting slogans demanding a debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the din, the house was adjourned till 12 noon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Thursday, Ananth Kumar had said in Lok Sabha that treasury benches wanted a debate on the Agusta Westland issue and said the names of Congress leaders were mentioned in middleman Christian Michel's diary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He had also mentioned the sting operation by the India Today groups which showed leaders from Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Bahujan Samaj Party (the BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Janta Dal-United (JD-U).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leaders were caught on camera at their party offices negotiating terms for changing demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ao/in/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi on Friday met Prime minister Narendra Modi seeking a waiver of loans given to farmers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Gandhi-led Congress delegation also raised the issue of farmer suicides with Modi and urged him to write off the loans given to farmers like it has been done in the case of corporates.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Thousands of farmers are committing suicide across the country. Every single day a farmer is committing suicide in Punjab. We met the Prime Minister and apprised him about the plight of farmers across the country,&amp;quot; Gandhi told the media. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This government has waived off loans of Rs 1.40 lakh crore to corporates. So we urged the government to waive off the loans of the farmers as well,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The delegation comprised senior Congress leaders including Punjab state unit chief Captain Amarinder Singh and Leader of Congress in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gandhi also said that the government decision to remove import duty on wheat was a &amp;quot;terrible blow&amp;quot; to the farmers.      &lt;br&gt;    &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Prime Minister too admitted the condition of the farmers to be grave. But he did not say anything about waiving off the loans to farmers,&amp;quot; he said.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gandhi's meeting with Modi comes days after he vowed to expose the Prime Minister's &amp;quot;personal complicity in corruption&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;and/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Toronto, Dec 16 (IANS) With the help of a new method, researchers can detect roughly 10 black holes per year -- doubling the number currently known within two years -- and unlock their history in a little more than a decade.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Within the next 10 years, there will be sufficient accumulated data on enough black holes that researchers can statistically analyse their properties as a population,&amp;quot; said Avery Broderick, Professor at University of Waterloo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This information will allow us to study stellar mass black holes at various stages that often extend billions of years,&amp;quot; added Broderick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers came up with the method that has implications for the emerging field of gravitational wave astronomy and the way in which we search for black holes and other dark objects in space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We do not yet know how rare these events are and how many black holes are generally distributed across the galaxy,&amp;quot; said Broderick, adding that &amp;quot;for the first time, we will be placing all the amazing dynamical physics that Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) sees into a larger astronomical context.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published in The Astrophysical Journal, proposes a bolder approach to detect and study black holes not as single entities but in large numbers as a system by combining two standard astrophysical tools in use today -- microlensing and radio wave interferometry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although very little is known about the inner workings of black holes, the integral part they play in the lifecycle of stars and regulate the growth of galaxies is known. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this year, LIGO presented the first direct proof of the existence of black holes when it detected gravitational waves from the collision of two black holes merging into one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a dark object, such as a black hole, passes between us and another light source, gravitational microlensing occurs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers proposed using radio waves to take multiple snapshots of the microlensing event in real time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When you look at the same event using a radio telescope -- interferometry -- you can actually resolve more than one image. That is what gives us the power to extract all kinds of parameters, like the object's mass, distance and velocity,&amp;quot; noted Mansour Karami, doctoral student University of Waterloo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Lucknow, Dec 16 (IANS) As Uttar Pradesh braces for the forthcoming assembly polls, it is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'D' (demonetisation) versus Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's 'D' (development).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so, while the saffron camp is in a huddle to decide its strategy to hard-sell demonetisation and try to comfort people reeling under an acute shortage of cash, the ruling Samajwadi Party (SP) is trying to trump it up with a string of development projects that it has presided over in its four-and-a-half years' rule in India's most populous state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's no wonder hence that in the past one month or so, Akhilesh Yadav's schedule has been packed with ribbon-cutting ceremonies and foundation stone-laying events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Officials told IANS that in this period, the Chief Minister has dedicated to the people of the state projects worth several crores of rupees. These include riverfront projects on the Gomti in Lucknow, inauguration of the fancy, hi-tech and sprawling Chief Minister's Secretariat, the trial run of a small stretch of the Lucknow Metro Rail, and the 302-km long Agra-Lucknow Expressway which cuts the travel time between the Taj city and the state capital by nearly half. Many projects are also lined up for Jhansi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a tenure riddled by poor law and order, nepotism, internal bickering, family feuds and communal flare-ups, close aides of Yadav admit that &amp;quot;development was the tagline the ruling party was pitching hard&amp;quot; to the people of the state, who for now seemingly are undecided on who their next ruler would be. While 'vikas' (development) was the line mandarins in the state government were asked to toe after SP's disastrous showing at the hustings when its tally slumped to a mere four in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The campaign has gained momentum in the month after demonetisation, avers a senior official in charge of the government's publicity in the election year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Chief Minister is aware of the perils of demonetisation and it is a smart move to magnify it to the people and juxtapose it with the work we have initiated in our regime,&amp;quot; a senior minister said. Harvard professor Steve Jardinge and his team, who are looking after UP's election campaign too, are learnt to have asked the 43-year-old to &amp;quot;play it up&amp;quot; and ice it with his development agenda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, Akhilesh Yadav inaugurated through a remote control several projects in Noida and Greater Noida, the neighbouring suburbs of New Delhi, trying to strike a cord with the urban elite and middle class, which particularly is reeling under the demonetisation blues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Prime Minister Modi has hugely erred in demonetisation and, through the ill-planned move, has made people stand out on roads in long, never-ending queues, I am sure the people will give him a befitting reply through the ballot in the forthcoming state assembly polls,&amp;quot; Yadav said. He also pointed to the &amp;quot;gigantic strides&amp;quot; Uttar Pradesh has taken under his watch in strengthening the power sector, the re-laying and expansion of roads, improved and free healthcare and better education system, among other &amp;quot;achievements&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sources say that before the Election Commission announces the poll schedule, the electorate is being fed with material in the form of booklets, books, posters, TV commercials and radio jingles of the &amp;quot;unprecedented development&amp;quot; in the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The politics of demonetisation versus the development campaign is already being handled by the party through the hush hush and low decibel campaigns by SP cadres in the countryside and its known faces in the urban areas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opposition, including Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is predictably not amused. While the saffron camp is taken aback by Yadav's frontal charge against demonetisation, it is sharpening its knives to take on the note ban, which, till not long ago, was said to be their ace as they go to the electorate early next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the fact that the attacks on demonetisation by SP leaders have begun to hurt them appear true as state BJP leaders are learnt to have briefed Modi during his brief stopover at Amausi airport recently. The angst was reflected in the cellphone address by the Prime Minister to the people in Bahraich. where he named the SP for the first time as being &amp;quot;most troubled by his drive against black money and demonetisation&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BJP leaders promise a &amp;quot;befitting response&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;coming days&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;They have half-baked development schemes and are playing politics. The people are smart enough to see through this,&amp;quot; said state BJP general secretary Vijay Bahadur Pathak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The party has so far unleashed its union ministers, front-rung leaders and Lok Sabha members in its 'Parivartan Yatras' criss-crossing the state to let people know the benefits of demonetisation and expose the state government. Soon &amp;quot;kamal khilao&amp;quot; -- let the lotus (BJP's symbol) bloom -- campaigns will be set rolling to garner support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arch rival Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) too echoes similar sentiments. &amp;quot;Akhilesh is rushing through incomplete projects as he has nothing to show in his report card, people are going to teach him and Modi a lesson while siding with us in the coming elections,&amp;quot; claims Mayawati. The jury is, however, out on the rival claims, and the people of the electorally-crucial state will speak their minds in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Mohit Dubey can be contacted at mohit.d@ians.in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;md/vm/ky/sac/ky/tb&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>San Juan (Puerto Rico), Dec 16 (IANS) Puerto Rico star Monica Puig, the surprise winner of the Rio Olympics women's singles tennis tournament, sent a message of hope to residents of the Caribbean island who are suffering the consequences of the severe economic crisis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puig traveled to her birthplace to play an exhibition match in here on Thursday against Russia's Maria Sharapova, who was suspended from the WTA Tour earlier this year after testing positive for a recently banned heart medication but has been cleared to return to the circuit in 2017, reports Efe news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Where there's a will, there's a way. With a positive attitude, we can move forward,&amp;quot; Puerto Rico's first and only Olympic gold medalist said in a press conference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Puig said she was aware of the crisis facing the island, which has been in recession for a decade and is seeking to restructure more than $60 billion in public debt, but urged people to continue to persevere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Every day you can find some enjoyment despite the problems,&amp;quot; said Puig, who makes infrequent trips to the island because of her travels on the WTA Tour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of her tennis, the 32-ranked Puig said her exhibition match against Sharapova was a good chance to fine-tune her game ahead of the Australian Open, a major event that gets under way on January 16.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The match was perfect for my preparations, especially because I was playing against a five-time Grand Slam winner,&amp;quot; the Puerto Rican said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharapova, who joined Puig at the press conference, said she was happy to make her first-ever visit to Puerto Rico even though she did not have enough time on this occasion to visit San Juan properly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But I hope to come back with more time to enjoy the weather, the food and the dancing,&amp;quot; the Russian star said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The Internet of Things (IoT) will be a dominant factor to drive internet growth in the country with 75 per cent of respondents vouching for it, a new survey by Mahindra Comviva said on Friday.&lt;p&gt;Mobility solutions firm Mahindra Comviva with online communication hub Mobile World Live said 35 per cent of respondents believe IoT to be the prevailing digital service to generate incremental revenue rises for operators in developed markets -- ahead of enterprise cloud, mobile financial services (MFS) and infotainment and enterprise mobility.

\&amp;quot;When it comes to operator challenges, 35 per cent of respondents are most concerned about future capital expenditure (capex) and operational expenditure (Opex) related issues. Customer retention was cited as the second major concern by 31 per cent of respondents ahead of spectrum availability, issues related to backhaul and fronthaul networks and network availability,\&amp;quot; the report found.

Also, 36 per cent of respondents believe that the financial institutions like Visa and MasterCard will dominate mobile payment ecosystem ahead of social platforms like WeChat, BBM Money and Facebook Messenger.

The survey also stated that about 60 per cent of operators believe mobile wallets to replace physical wallets in next 3-10 years and to generate revenue from mobile financial services (MFS), around 51 per cent of respondents consider international money transfer as the greatest opportunity. 

Talking about 5G, the report said although 5G standards are yet to be defined, 5G network is expected to act as a catalyst for a wide range of services, both on the enterprise and consumer side.

\&amp;quot;With many elements to 5G, 32 per cent of respondents put IoT as the dominant reason why 5G will be the game changer the business of tomorrows. For 28 per cent of respondents; 5G will help new technologies to emerge with a major growth in smarter cities deployment and healthcare applications,\&amp;quot; the survey pointed out.

Twenty five per cent of respondents said 5G will connect billions of devices to the network. 

In terms of content usage, 39 per cent respondents stated \&amp;quot;Entertainment\&amp;quot; (including games and music, along with video) as the most popular segment of content consumed on their networks followed by the use of social media and chat applications with 35 per cent and 11 per cent respectively.

Fifty three per cent of the respondents pointed out affordability as the major hurdle in broadband adoption followed by lack of awareness, lack of relevant content and a absence of access to digital mediums.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 16 (IANS) A new planetary system has been discovered with a host star similar to the Earth's Sun but its unusual composition indicates that it has 'eaten' some of its planets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study that was published in the journal &amp;quot;Astronomy and Astrophysics&amp;quot; suggest that this new discovery can provide clues to researchers about how planetary systems evolve over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It does not mean that the Sun will 'eat' the Earth any time soon,&amp;quot; said Jacob Bean, Assistant Professor University of Chicago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, &amp;quot;our discovery provides an indication that violent histories may be common for planetary systems, including our own&amp;quot; Bean said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1995, astronomers discovered the first planet orbiting a star other than the sun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two thousand exoplanets were identified since then including some rare planets that orbit a star similar to Earth's Sun.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at University of Chicago studied star HIP68468, which is 300 light years away, as part of a multi-year project to discover planets that orbit solar twins. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is tricky to draw conclusions from a single system to study more stars like this to see whether this is a common outcome of the planet formation process,&amp;quot; cautioned Megan Bedell, co-author of the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers said that the study of HIP68468 was a post-mortem of this process happening around another star similar to our sun and that the discovery deepened their understanding of the evolution of planetary systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;HIP68468's composition points to a history of ingesting planets. It contains four times more lithium than would be expected for a star that is six billion years old, as well as a surplus of refractory elements -- metals resistant to heat that are abundant in rocky planets,&amp;quot; the research found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists used the 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile to discover their first exoplanet in 2015. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The more recent discovery needs to be confirmed, but includes two planet candidates -- a super Neptune and a super Earth. Their orbits are surprisingly close to their host star, with one 50 per cent more massive than Neptune and located at a Venus-like distance from its star. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The other, the first super Earth around a solar twin, is three times the Earth's mass and so close to its star that its orbit takes just three days,&amp;quot; the study noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scientists said that these two planets most likely did not form where they see them today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Instead, they probably migrated inward from the outer parts of the planetary system. Other planets could have been ejected from the system -- or ingested by their host star,&amp;quot; the researchers added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers continue to explore more than 60 solar twins, eyeing for more exoplanets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/in/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 16 (IANS) Ram Gopal Varma has announced his next movie titled &amp;quot;Shashikala&amp;quot;, and says it is the story of a &amp;quot;dearest closest friend of a politician&amp;quot;. The title and plot suggests the film has a lot to do with former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa's close aide V.K. Sasikala but the filmmaker says the project is &amp;quot;fictional&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Varma on Thursday night announced the title of the film. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He tweeted: &amp;quot;Just registered my new film title 'Shashikala'. It's the story of a very dearest closest friend of a politician and completely fictional.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Known for helming movies on real life incidents, Varma added: &amp;quot;'Shashikala' is going to be a very very sincere from the heart Tamilian love story and absolutely nothing to with fictional non-politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Fictional non-politics of Shashikala have a fundamental contradiction with highly truthful but assumed non-truths of Jayalalithaa.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 54-year-old filmmaker said he has immense respect for Jayalalithaa, who died in Chennai on December 5. Now members of AIADMK are requesting Sasikala, her close aide, to become the political party's General Secretary, but she is yet to give her consent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I immensely respect Jayalalithaa, but I honestly respect Shasikalaji a little bit much much much more. Jayalalithaaji respected Shasikalaji much more than she respected anybody else proves why I should call my film 'Shashikala',&amp;quot; he tweeted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Jayalalithaa seen through the eyes of Sasikala is much more poetic and honest thought than seeing Jayalalithaa only through Jayalalitha,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently he is busy filming the third instalment of the popular crime thriller franchise &amp;quot;Sarkar&amp;quot;. The film features megastar Amitabh Bachchan, Yami Gautam and Manoj Bajpayee in pivotal roles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dc/rb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The BJP on Friday criticised the Congress for not acting against black money hoarders during the last three years of the UPA-II tenure, whereas the Modi government formed an SIT on the matter.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said that even the CPI-M was supporting the Congress, resisting action against stemming black money.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The minister was speaking to the media after the BJP parliamentary meet ahead of the parliament session on Friday.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Earlier, the party in power used to be involved in scams and the opposition used to unite in fighting against it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Now, when the party at the Centre is taking action to root out corruption and black money, their attempts are being scuttled by the opposition,&amp;quot; he added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We need to think on where we stand now,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said the BJP believes in putting the nation before the party, while the Congress's ideology did not concur with this line of thought. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The party members also greeted External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj over her recovery from kidney transplant and on being included among top 100 global thinkers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vn/in/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Los Angeles, Dec 16 (IANS) TV host and comedian Steve Harvey has been officially roped in to host the 2016 Miss Universe show, a year after he made an embarrassing mistake by announcing the wrong winner at the pageant's 2015 edition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2015, the 59-year-old comedian wrongly announced Miss Colombia Ariadna Gutierrez as the winner, while she was the first runner-up. She had received the crown, sash and flowers before Harvey returned to the stage to tell the crowd that he read his cue card wrong, reports aceshowbiz.com. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I have to apologize, the first runner-up is Colombia. Let me just take control of this. This is exactly what's on the card. I will take responsibility for this. It was my mistake... horrible mistake,&amp;quot; he had said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, Miss Universe Paulina Vega later took the crown off Gutierrez's head and put it on Miss Philippines Pia Wurtzbach's. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the major slip-up, Harvey was publicly ridiculed and he even received death threats. Speaking about how he felt when he went back on the stage, he said in an interview: &amp;quot;It was four minutes of pure hell... It was the most gut-wrenching walk I've ever had in my life.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2016 Miss Universe pageant will take place in the Philippines on January 29, 2017. Model Ashley Graham will serve as the backstage host. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dc/rb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Hyderabad/New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) In your youth, you must have played platform games like &amp;quot;Street Fighter,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Pacman&amp;quot; and the quintessential &amp;quot;Mario&amp;quot; on huge coin-operated machines in dingy ice-cream parlors with joysticks and buttons. Nearly two decades later, video gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation have become a runaway hit among youth and the craze is only growing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One difference between then and now: Some part or the other of today's games are now made in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After realising its immense potential, global videogame developers and publishers are now making a beeline to outsource work in a country which offers cost benefits and advantages like talent, efficiency and low management costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While some leading global players are already outsourcing from India, others are planning their presence in the emerging market -- currently pegged at $300 million and expected to rise to $1.2 billion by 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some developers like Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Zynga and Sumo Digital have already set up shop in India and developers/publishers like Rockstar, Disney, Sony Europe, Sony US and Microsoft Game Studios are already outsourcing from the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industry observers say a majority of the big players prefer to outsource from India to derive the cost advantage. The trend is to have key strategic partners for working on their projects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report by the NASSCOM Gaming Forum released last month, the Indian market for applied (video) games is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 14-16 per cent, from $40 million in 2016 to $80 million in 2021. Currently across India there are 40 developers of applied games (Independent studios, IT firms venturing into Applied Games and e-learning companies).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Both mobile games and applied games markets are witnessing rapid growth. The companies are making products for the international as well as Indian market,&amp;quot; said Rajesh Rao, Chairman, NASSCOM Gaming Forum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to him, the mobile games market is just beginning to open. &amp;quot;India is now number five in overall (mobile game) downloads. The market is growing rapidly as we are adding 100 million smart phones every year,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China is many years ahead of India, but he is confident that with a large young population, India will catch up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;London-based Keywords Studios, which is the No.1 games services company in the world, is looking to make India the hub for its operations. Listed on the London Stock Exchange, the company is into various segments of video games like art, game-testing, audio and game localisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keywords, which acquired Lakshya Digital, India's largest and one of the top five global games services companies, in 2014, wants to bring all its service lines to India in a couple of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides Lakshya Digital, which does the art and animation part of the games, Keywords has a game-testing division in India that grew to 100 employees within a year of its launch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We made a pitch at the London Stock Exchange and the investors wanted Keywords to look at India seriously. They have seen what India has done in BPO. The games are not just about art but also about programming and technology,&amp;quot; Manvendra Shukul, Country Manager for Keywords and CEO of Lakshya, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Rajeev Singh, Managing Director of the Indian arm of Taiwanese tech major BenQ, India &amp;quot;boasts of a strong presence of technologically-inclined skilled workforce equipped to address various stages of game developments and this has helped Indian developers and programmers get recognised at a global level&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said the understanding amongst the gaming developers in India &amp;quot;has evolved with availability of right resources along with companies pumping in the right amount of awareness and avenues for skill development which have in turn taken Indian developers to newer heights. Companies like UBIsoft and EA (Electronic Arts), which are prolific game developers, are increasingly moving to India for game development to take advantage of our cost-effective technical talent&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Mohammed Shafeeq can be contacted at m.shafeeq@ians.in and Anuj Sharma can be contacted at anuj.s@ians.in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ms-as/vm/ky/sac/ky/tb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

In fact, over 2.5 billion emojis, photos, stickers and videos are sent every day on Messenger,&amp;quot; the company said in a blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In some ways the camera is now replacing the keyboard. As more people use Messenger in their everyday lives, we wanted to make it faster, simpler and more fun to send photos and videos. So we built the new Messenger camera,&amp;quot; Facebook said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new camera is quicker than previous versions which makes it easier for users to capture and share moments as they happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you are already in a conversation or have just opened up the app, you will see the shutter button centre in the screen. A tap takes photo and a long press records a video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The social media giant also introduced new art and special effects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are especially excited to debut 3D masks and special effects, which make it super easy to apply an artistic filter to your full screen photo and to turn your world into a work of art,&amp;quot; the company said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook has also incorporated thousands of stickers, frames, masks and effects in the app. A user can also create text, add art and stickers to the text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sku/py/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Jakarta, Dec 16 (IANS) United Nations Environment Programme chief Erik Solheim has hailed Indonesia's efforts to become a leader in environmental sustainability, especially conserving peatlands, on his first official visit to the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Solheim here on Thursday met government officials, including Vice President Muhammad Jusuf Kalla and Minister of Environment and Forests Siti Nurbaya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The UN Environment welcomes the ambitions of Indonesia to become a regional and global leader on environmental sustainability,&amp;quot; a statement quoted Solheim as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indonesia has made ambitious climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new moratorium on clearing peatlands -- world's largest terrestrial organic soil carbon stock -- is an important step towards achieving those commitments, as is the government target of restoring two million hectares of degraded and burned peatlands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Progressive legislation is now in place to address deforestation, though law enforcement needs to improve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The private sector in Indonesia has made commitments to zero deforestation, though more can be done to implement and monitor these voluntary commitments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a roundtable with major Indonesian palm oil, rubber, pulp and paper companies, Solheim explored ways to move forward on their zero deforestation pledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I am encouraged by the willingness of the private sector to change. Degradation of the environment can no longer be the main basis for business. I value the promises made by the private sector. Now is the time for action,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's possible to protect remaining rainforests and restore degraded lands, and at the same time grow the agricultural sector and economic productivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Indonesia's environmental issues are also global issues. Peat and forest fires pose regional and global risks to human health and the climate. Indonesia should receive international support for its efforts to address these challenges,&amp;quot; Solheim said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Jakarta, Solheim also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Centre for International Forestry Research that will foster joint action on preserving tropical landscapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Global Peatlands Initiative led by the UN Environment Programme to conserve peatlands was launched at the UN climate summit in Marrakech in Morocco on November 17 to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will mobilise governments, international organisations and academia in a targeted effort to protect peatlands, which contain almost 100 times more carbon than tropical forests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year's raging fires in Indonesia's peatlands cloaked Southeast Asia in toxic haze.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Peat, which is used as a fuel, consists of partially decayed plant material, which has accumulated under waterlogged conditions over a long period of time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tropical peatlands are home to a number of endangered species, including Sumatran tigers, gorillas and orangutans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vg/py/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 16 (IANS) The Indian design fraternity and consumers must realise the importance of being \&amp;quot;swadeshi\&amp;quot; -- a concept in indigenousness promoted by Mahatma Gandhi -- in their fashion statements, says veteran designer Madhu Jain, who is gearing to launch a new eco-friendly textile in 2017 to mark three decades of her label.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;I think swadeshi. My grandfather was a freedom fighter... My way of thinking is very different and I\'m very nationalistic. I feel that we have to uphold the sanctity of our national costumes and save it from extinction,\&amp;quot; Jain told IANS in an interview.

\&amp;quot;What has happened to the sari should not happen to the salwar kameez. Young people have started wearing more of saris, but a lot more needs to be done. It just needs to be made attractive so that everyone wants a piece of it,\&amp;quot; she added.

A textile conservationist and craft revivalist, Jain feels a dire need to restore the traditional crafts and weaving techniques that seem to be going out of the market.

\&amp;quot;Fashion is a very powerful platform -- make it, give it visibility, create a demand for the product and move on,\&amp;quot; said the designer -- distinct in the fashion circuit for her khadi chogas -- whose collections with Kalamkari, Kantha and Ikat have been \&amp;quot;successful experiments\&amp;quot;.

\&amp;quot;People work so hard in their countries to preserve their culture; I don\'t know what is happening in India. Gandhi fought all along to preserve swadeshi, and today he would probably be turning in his grave thinking what\'s happening,\&amp;quot; she added.

Having showcased her creations across different countries during her career, Jain, who had even introduced bamboo fibre as a textile alternative, said Indian designers must \&amp;quot;showcase the best of what our country has to offer\&amp;quot;.

She feels that with Sunil Sethi at the helm of affairs at the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) -- India\'s apex fashion body -- the use of handloom in the fashion circuit is rampant like never before.

\&amp;quot;After Mr. Sethi came into FDCI, things changed a lot. He has an old-world upbringing. He understands craft and so he gives it a platform. Like, look how fashionable Benarasi is today. And how fashionable Chanderi is going to become. I see a lot of positive influences coming in,\&amp;quot; she said, and added how leaders of the nation, especially, can drive people\'s fashion choices.

\&amp;quot;Mrs Indira Gandhi was known for her sari collections, and till today she is remembered for the elegance with which she flaunted them,\&amp;quot; Jain said and also mentioned veteran actress Rekha\'s majestic Kanjeevarams.

The designer believes that the strength of Indian fashion lies in its textiles, and designers need to increasingly promote it. She is doing her bit by launching a new textile next year.

\&amp;quot;I work very closely with the artisans and weavers; so I know which designers work with the weavers and which do not. About 90 per cent of the designers pick up ready materials, which is not the way it\'s done. You have to develop your own textile.

\&amp;quot;Next year, we will launch a very special eco-friendly textile,\&amp;quot; she said of her plans of celebrating her 30 years in the industry.

Looking back at her journey, Jain said: \&amp;quot;I am completely self-made. In our times, women never really worked. I am happy that I could do something out of my life. Who used to work in the 1970s? I have no regrets.\&amp;quot;

<content><![CDATA[ <p>North Korea's government banned sarcastic comments against it (they actually did, this is not a joke); so I sent them an email: &amp;quot;Great idea, you bunch of geniuses.&amp;quot; They're sure to thank me.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world's gone mad. A reader sent me a news story about police checking so-called &amp;quot;sacks of rice&amp;quot; which drivers were delivering across a border and discovering that the bundles were really -- (creepy music) -- dead bodies. No, wait. I just read the item again. What it actually says is that the driver told police he was moving dead bodies but shocked officers discovered that the bundles were really bags of rice. This took place recently in Nigeria, where tax is payable on imported foods but not on corpses. &amp;quot;Nothing to see here, officer, just dead people.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You sure it's not grocery items?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It reminded me of a time a few years ago when a friend was at the security gate at Phnom Penh airport. He put his bag through the x-ray machine, and the guy next to him put his AK-47 machine gun through the machine. &amp;quot;What were the guards looking for inside the machine gun?&amp;quot; he pondered. &amp;quot;Men's cosmetics?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humanity is now officially insane. More proof: a top drug watchdog in the United States recently revealed that after Wall Street took over pharmaceutical firms, ordinary prescription pain pills cost six times as much as illegal drugs from your local pusher. Both make you feel better, but the cheaper one comes with a trip around Jupiter on a pink space elephant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A colleague who covers fashion said that her world had always been mad, but the insanity level had risen alarmingly. Her evidence: Top fashion company Golden Goose just launched cheap fabric shoes that look old, shabby, broken and held together by duct tape. &amp;quot;Distressed Superstar Sneakers&amp;quot; look exactly like the ancient things you find in the bottom of your teenagers' cupboard -- but are hot fashion items costing $585 a pair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why can't buyers just look in the bottoms of their own teenagers' cupboards and get the exact same thing with the added realism of that stinky feet smell?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More backwards logic came from a drought-ridden part of the US. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power banned people from using sprinklers on their lawns -- and then were exposed using sprinklers to water their own grass. Officials pointed out that their lawn was not grass, but plastic turf, which benefited from regular cleaning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did find one example of modern reverse-logic that was actually positive. On a visit to Kampala, I saw posters advertising &amp;quot;ladies' shape&amp;quot; pills: &amp;quot;Bottom not big enough? Now you can increase its size easily and quickly,&amp;quot; they said. My host assured me the product was completely serious, despite the fact that I did not see anyone who needed it, as bottoms in my field of view (not that I am an expert on this subject) ranged from &amp;quot;immense&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Rock of Gibraltar&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Himalayan&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Okay, I just noticed that my shoes are ancient, falling apart, and have a hole in the left sole. If you'll excuse me, I need to nip over to New York to score a big sale. Fashionistas gonna love them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Nury Vittachi is an Asia-based frequent traveller.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 16 (IANS) Using the internet in classrooms for study purposes, is likely to affect academic performance, even among the most intelligent and motivated of students, researchers warned.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When internet is used in classrooms, students tend to spend most of their time on social media, reading email, shopping for items such as clothes or watching videos, that could lead to poorer scores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Internet's use was a significant predictor of students' final exam score, even when their intelligence and motivation were taken into account, said lead author Susan Ravizza, Associate Professor Michigan State University in the US. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The detrimental relationship associated with non-academic internet use raises questions about the policy of encouraging students to bring their laptops to class when they are unnecessary for class use,&amp;quot; Ravizza said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous research has shown that taking notes on a laptop is not as beneficial for learning as writing notes by hand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Once students crack their laptop open, it is probably tempting to do other sorts of internet-based tasks that are not class-relevant,&amp;quot; Ravizza added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the team studied internet use on laptop in a one-hour lecture course with 127 students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study showed that using the internet for class purposes did not help students' test scores. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings are forthcoming in the journal Psychological Science. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/in&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

This is the day when we achieved a decisive victory and created a new country,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the next canisterised test for Agni V missile, the minister said he would not like to comment much on it and said: &amp;quot;Testing goes on, I will not comment much.

It spells out a set of recommended dos and don'ts that you should practise in order to improve your Karmic wealth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book talks about the types of Karma, Karmic laws, and the resulting profits and losses, Karmic assets and liabilities, generation of Karmic wealth, carving out a better future, serving ancestors and finally willing your wealth to yourself.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>United Nations, Dec 16 (IANS) UN Secretary-General designate Antonio Guterres has selected women representing Asia, Africa and Latin America for three top jobs as the foundation of his pledge to promote gender parity and geographic diversity at the world body.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his first personnel appointments, he nominated Nigeria\'s Environment Minister Amina Mohammed to be the deputy secretary-general.

Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti of Brazil is to be his chef de cabinet and Kyung-wha Kang of South Korea his special advisor on policy, a new position.

Gutterres told reporters after his swearing in on Monday that his priority would be to appoint more women to top jobs in order to achieve gender parity at the world body.

\&amp;quot;I am happy to count on the efforts of these three highly competent women from different regions of the world,\&amp;quot; he said on Thursday. 

\&amp;quot;These appointments are the foundations of my team, which I will continue to build, respecting my pledges on gender parity and geographical diversity.\&amp;quot;

The three appointments of women comes after the failure of the UN to elect a woman as the secretary-general despite a strong campaign on their behalf and the emergence of several strong women candidates.

Women are under-represented at all levels in the UN bureaucracy. Only 17 of the 79 under-secretaries-general are women.

Mohammed was Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\'s special advisor on post-2015 development planning before returning to Nigeria as environment minister.

The daughter of a Nigerian father and a British mother, her entire career was spent on development and related issues.

A career diplomat, Viotti is now Brazil\'s ambassador to Germany. Before that she was at the UN as her country\'s permanent representative.

Kang, who was once a broadcast journalist, works for the US as an assistant secretary-general and deputy emergency relief coordinator. Earlier she was the deputy high commissioner for human rights.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>San Francisco, Dec 16 (IANS) Responding to criticism from all quarters over the spread of fake news, Facebook has asked its users to flag fake news stories which will be verified by third party fact-checkers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to media reports, Facebook was going to work with five fact-checking agencies - ABC News, AP, FactCheck.org, Politifact and Snopes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook believes in giving people a voice and that it could not become arbiters of truth itself, said Adam Mosseri, vice president of Facebook's News Feed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The social networking platform was victim of fake news posts during the US presidential election in November.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We've focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organisations,&amp;quot; Mosseri wrote in a statement on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The proliferation of hoax and fake content on its platform apparently significantly affected public opinion during the recently-concluded US political campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook is now looking into four broader areas to address this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We're testing several ways to make it easier to report a hoax if you see one on Facebook, which you can do by clicking the upper right hand corner of a post. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We've relied heavily on our community for help on this issue, and this can help us detect more fake new,&amp;quot; Mosseri said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We've started a programme to work with third-party fact checking organisations that are signatories of Poynter's International Fact Checking Code of Principles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We'll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organisations,&amp;quot; he further added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If the fact-checking organisations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why,&amp;quot; Mosseri wrote. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stories that were disputed may also appear lower in News Feed&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It will still be possible to share these stories, but you will see a warning that the story has been disputed as you share,&amp;quot; he noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once a story is flagged, it can't be made into an ad and promoted, either.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We've found that if reading an article makes people significantly less likely to share it, that may be a sign that a story has misled people in some way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We're going to test incorporating this signal into ranking, specifically for articles that are outliers, where people who read the article are significantly less likely to share it,&amp;quot; the Facebook executive explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook has found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organisations, and posting hoaxes that get people to visit to their sites, which are often mostly ads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So we're doing several things to reduce the financial incentives. On the buying side, we've eliminated the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to be real publications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;On the publisher side, we are analysing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary,&amp;quot; Mosseri announced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said the company was committed to weed out &amp;quot;the worst of the worst&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/in&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Title: The English Teacher; Author: Yiftach Reicher Atir (translated by Philip Simpson); Publisher: Penguin; Pages: 272; Price: Rs 399&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For any spy agency, even more worrisome than the possibility of its agents abroad being unmasked and inviting some sort of reprisal from the targeted country, is the prospect of its spies (or even ex-spies for that matter), their heads full with secrets, going missing. And it can take any measure to forestall such an eventuality or neutralise the threat.

On the other hand, the spies, who have lived in hostile territory under false identities, with constant fear of exposure or betrayal, and unable to strike any relationship that doesn\'t involve deception or manipulation, can never fully return to a normal life. And if they find that their bosses are not appreciative or have been less than honest with them, their response can be unpredictable -- and dangerous.

Even, top agencies like Israel\'s Mossad are not exempt from this phenomenon. And it is this service itself that serves as a backdrop for this stark, haunting tale, written by a senior Israeli military intelligence official, on the moral costs of espionage and the dilemmas between personal and professional loyalties that covert work engenders.

Having intimately known many operatives who worked alone for long periods in enemy countries \&amp;quot;armed with nothing but a foreign passport, a fake identity, extensive training, and inexplicable courage\&amp;quot;, as he had sent them on missions, charted their progress, and anxiously awaited their safe return, the author says he wondered what \&amp;quot;is it like to live a secret life among one\'s enemies for months and years\&amp;quot;.

\&amp;quot;I knew what it was like to be in battle and to cross borders in the night to execute military operations; I had no idea what it would be like to live across those borders. How does one deal with the ever-present fear, and the great loneliness? And what happens to the heart?\&amp;quot; says Atir, who also participated in the Entebbe Raid in 1976.

The story, a \&amp;quot;result of those wonderings\&amp;quot;, features semi-retired Mossad agent Rachel Goldschmitt, whose sudden disappearance throws her agency into panic.

For, in the 15 years after she returned from undercover work in an unnamed Arab country (implied to be in North Africa but could be easily Syria too) where she \&amp;quot;executed\&amp;quot; several sensitive missions, including assassinating an ex-Nazi scientist, she had worked in the agency\'s office and was privy to many secrets.

Visiting London for the funeral of her father, with whom she had a distant and difficult relationship, she chances on something in his study, which leads her to make a cryptic phone call to her former case officer and go off the radar.

The now retired officer, reports her disappearance and is put in charge of figuring her whereabouts. He approaches a retired senior who suggests they go through her past and career in detail to figure out the reasons for her action and probable intentions.

Thus most of the story occurs in flashback, as we follow Rachel\'s exploits in the enemy territory where she worked as a teacher of English (hence the title), met a rather privileged student, from whom she got some good intelligence -- surreptitiously -- and also fell in love but had to leave abruptly without any word. We also come to know Ehud was himself in love with her but could never reveal it.

Towards the end, when the duo of ex-spies figure where Rachel could have gone and informs the powers that be, the orders that come are indicative that the story is not going to end very happily -- and there is a shocking side-effect too.

The unnamed cities and countries may create some confusion but as Atir says, \&amp;quot;the book spent many months with the Israeli civilian and military censorship committees\&amp;quot; and \&amp;quot;numerous changes and omissions were imposed, until the book was approved for publication\&amp;quot; and so it is a \&amp;quot;true story, of real-life operatives that are wholly made-up, and actual missions that never happened\&amp;quot;.

What holds interest beyond the account of the demanding minutiae of espionage work, is the emotional cost and moral choices for its practitioners, especially in executing policies ordered by a faraway, inexorable and unfeeling state. The story is not a comforting read at all but a vital one for all that.

<description><![CDATA[ United Nations, Dec 16 (IANS) India has called for the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) to prevent terrorists getting weapons of mass destruction (WMD).]]></description>
<content><![CDATA[ <p>United Nations, Dec 16 (IANS) India has called for the adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) to prevent terrorists getting weapons of mass destruction (WMD).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chastising nations for holding it up, India\'s Deputy Permanent Representative Tanmaya Lal emphasised the need for adopting the CCIT, which has been hung up in the UN for two decades.

Lal said, \&amp;quot;Such delay hints at a lack of collective will on an existentialist issue that has become the most serious threat to world peace since 1945.\&amp;quot;

He was speaking on Thursday at the Security Council debate on the threat of WMDs falling into the hands of terrorists.

\&amp;quot;As a victim of terrorism for over three decades, India is cognizant of the catastrophic dangers that the transfer of WMDs to non-state actors and terrorists could entail,\&amp;quot; he said.  

\&amp;quot;The proliferation of WMDs and their means of delivery to non-state actors continues to constitute one of the biggest and most serious threats to international peace and security today.\&amp;quot;

He said that meeting the new proliferation challenges requires new approaches that differentiate between \&amp;quot;responsible States whose actions strengthen non-proliferation and those that weaken the realisation of its objectives.\&amp;quot;

Earlier, the Council unanimously called on all countries to strengthen national anti-proliferation laws to ensure that non-state actors don\'t get nuclear, biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction.

Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliason warned about WMDs becoming \&amp;quot;increasingly available\&amp;quot; to \&amp;quot;vicious non-state groups with no regard for human life.\&amp;quot;

He added, \&amp;quot;We have seen this in the use of chemical weapons by Islamic State (IS) in Syria and Iraq.\&amp;quot;

About the possibility of nuclear threats, he said there were legitimate concerns about the security of large stockpiles of weapons grade nuclear material outside international regulation.

\&amp;quot;Scientific advances have lowered barriers to the production of biological weapons,\&amp;quot;  he said. \&amp;quot;And emerging technologies, such as 3D printing and unmanned aerial vehicles, are adding to threats of an attack using a WMD.\&amp;quot;

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 16 (IANS) Workers laid off by Disney have filed a case against Disney alleging that replacing them with Indians was discrimination against them because they were Americans.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discrimination suit filed in a federal court in Florida on Monday said Disney dismissed the workers &amp;quot;based solely on their national origin and race, replacing them with Indian nationals&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 29 former information technology workers said in court papers seen by IANS that they were made to train their replacements starting October 2014 and the management treated them and the other 250 laid off workers rudely while the Indians were given &amp;quot;special treatment&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They claimed that they were treated differently based &amp;quot;solely on race or colour and ancestry&amp;quot;. They were laid off in January 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The suit was filed three days after President-elect Donald Trump had said at two rallies that he would not allow US workers to be replaced by foreigners and was especially miffed that Americans being laid off were made to train their replacements. It is &amp;quot;demeaning&amp;quot;, he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are not going to let it happen to our people any more.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A person of Indian origin, Lavanya Jagadean, is one of the 29 workers suing Disney and, therefore, lawyers said in court papers that Jagadean is not suing on the basis &amp;quot;national origin and race&amp;quot; discrimination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the case also invokes laws against age discrimination and Jagadean could be covered under that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This case was filed after a federal judge dismissed another case brought by laid off Disney employees in October against Disney and the two companies that provided it the Indian workers, HCL and Cognizant Technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Judge Gregory Presnell ruled that the three companies had not made false statements on certifications for the Visa programme that current workers would not be adversely affected, which was the basis of the case, according to the Orlando Sentinel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The newspaper said that the case filed in January, &amp;quot;alleged that the Disney employees were the victim of a racketeering scheme to terminate them and replace them with immigrant, outsourced workers through the federal H-1B Visa programme&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The case filed this week is only against Disney and takes a new approach by claiming discrimination against Americans by replacing them with younger Indians.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;al/lok&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 16 (IANS) A group of Democratic senators will present a bill that would obligate US President-elect Donald Trump to divest himself of any financial interests that may pose conflicts of interest and to place his assets in a blind trust, a specialised daily The Hill reported on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bill would also consider any violation of ethics laws or conflicts of interest by Trump &amp;quot;a high crime or misdemeanour under the impeachment clause of the US Constitution&amp;quot;, EFE news quoted the five sponsors as saying in a summary of the legislation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The American people deserve to know that the President of the United States is working to do what's best for the country -- not using his office to do what's best for himself and his businesses,&amp;quot; said Senator Elizabeth Warren -- one of the bill's sponsors -- in a statement on the measure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also sponsoring the bill are Sens. Ben Cardin, Chris Coons, Dick Durbin and Jeff Merkley, and they will formally present the legislation in Congress in January.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bill would require incoming First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, his wife Karen Pence, and Trump's youngest son Barron to abandon any financial assets that would pose a conflicts of interest and place them in blind trusts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bill would also prevent them from participating in matters that are directly related to the financial interests of the Trump family, or in businesses controlled by the President-elect or his wife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bill has a complicated future in a congress controlled by the Republicans, where the leading members of both chambers have expressed their interest in working with Trump despite the difference they had with him during the campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump had said that he would hold a press conference this week to lay out in detail how he will divest himself of his assets and businesses, but a couple of days ago he postponed that public appearance until January.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The magnate also has not released his tax returns, something that presidential candidates have done as a matter of course for decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 16 (IANS) US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he selected attorney David Friedman to be ambassador to Israel.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friedman was one of Trump's key advisers during the election campaign regarding US-Israeli relations, EFE news quoted a statement as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The future ambassador has been a long-time friend and trusted adviser to me. His strong relationships in Israel will form the foundation of his diplomatic mission and be a tremendous asset to our country as we strengthen the ties with our allies and strive for peace in the Middle East,&amp;quot; Trump said in the statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All US ambassadors nominated by the President must be confirmed by the Senate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friedman, 57, is currently a founding partner of a law firm having about 300 attorneys and which for the last 35 years has specialised in litigation and bankruptcies, according to the official communique.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The statement says that, with this nomination, Trump is reaffirming his commitment to improve relations between the two countries and guarantee that there will be &amp;quot;extraordinary&amp;quot; strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between Washington and Tel Aviv.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Trump's administration, after his Janaury 20 inauguration, the US-Israeli relationship will be a model of cooperation and respect, the statement adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friedman said in the statement announcing his nomination that he is looking forward to working &amp;quot;from the US Embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The President-elect has said he will move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, although Washington -- along with many other countries around the world -- does not currently recognise Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Israeli daily Haaretz, in reporting on the nomination, said that Friedman, an Orthodox Jew, is a columnist for two Israeli right-leaning media outlets: Arutz Sheva and The Jerusalem Post.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Haaretz, his positions are farther to the right than those of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

I am all for it. I adore her,&amp;quot; Faris told etonline.com.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To that, Pratt responded: &amp;quot;I can't believe you're Team Jen. That s***s.

Should the establishment of such safe zones work in Syria, he said it could also work in other crisis regions, where humanitarian aid could then be provided locally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both ministers also renewed calls for the establishment of refugee registration centres outside of Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, they said they wanted to work together with the Central European Defence Cooperation (CEDC) to develop their official position vis-a-vis both safe zones and registration centres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doskozil said this would serve as preparation should the EU refugee deal currently in place with Turkey collapse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>San Francisco, Dec 16 (IANS) Facebook, Inc. said on Thursday it was stepping up efforts against fake news and hoaxes by testing several ways to make it easier to report a hoax if users see one on the social media network.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xinhua news agency quoted Adam Mosseri, Vice President of Facebook in charge of news feed, as saying that the online social media and social networking service based in Menlo Park, Northern California, would &amp;quot;learn from these tests, and iterate and extend them over time&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We've started a program to work with third-party fact checking organisations that are signatories of Poynter's International Fact Checking Code of Principles,&amp;quot; Mosseri wrote on the company's blog. &amp;quot;We'll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organisations.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Posting a number of screen shots on a mobile device to illustrate how the new efforts would work, he noted: &amp;quot;If the fact checking organisations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it will still be possible to share these flagged stories, but a &amp;quot;warning that the story has been disputed&amp;quot; will pop up on the screen and a flagged story &amp;quot;can't be made into an ad and promoted&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook has been under pressure for a while that fake news stories have been abundant on its network during this US election year, misleading voters in a way that somehow has had impacted the result of the presidential election.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deflecting the political implication of criticism, Mosseri wrote: &amp;quot;We've found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated. Spammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organisations, and posting hoaxes that get people to visit their sites, which are often mostly ads. So we're doing several things to reduce the financial incentives.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;(Meanwhile) on the buying side we've eliminated the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to be real publications. On the publisher side, we are analysing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's important to us that the stories you see on Facebook are authentic and meaningful,&amp;quot; said the senior executive, adding that &amp;quot;we know there's more to be done. We're going to keep working on this problem for as long as it takes to get it right&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week, Facebook said it was working with Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to help curb the spread of terrorist contents online.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Charleston, Dec 16 (IANS) Self-proclaimed white supremacist Dylann Roof was convicted on Thursday of killing nine African Americans inside a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the next phase of the trial, scheduled to begin in January, jurors will weigh whether Roof, 22, should be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison, CNN reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deliberations began on Thursday afternoon in Roof's murder trial after attorneys made closing arguments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortly after deliberations started, the jury asked to again watch the video in which Roof confessed to two FBI agents. Specifically, the jury wanted to see the portion where Roof was unsure of how many people he had killed in the June 2015 massacre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roof, 22, has admitted to last year's killings at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prosecutors presented Roof as a &amp;quot;cold and calculating&amp;quot; killer. Jurors saw a witness whose son was killed sobbing on the stand. They heard an FBI agent read a series of Roof's racist writings. And they watched a video of Roof laughing after admitting he killed the victims.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The defence did not call any witnesses, and Roof did not testify.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a statement, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley said: &amp;quot;It is my hope that the survivors, the families, and the people of South Carolina can find some peace in the fact that justice has been served.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Southern Poverty Law Centre, in praising the verdict, said Roof &amp;quot;represents the modern face of domestic terrorism: the extremist who acts alone after being radicalised online.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When Roof searched 'black on white crime',  he found a flood of white supremacist propaganda. Once hard to access, that propaganda is now just a few keystrokes away from anyone, anywhere, who has access to the Internet,&amp;quot; President Richard Cohen said in the statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Counternarratives that expose the lies behind the propaganda often don't make the first page of search results.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 16 (IANS) The United Kingdom's fertility regulator gave a cautious go-ahead on Thursday to the in-vitro fertilisation of human eggs carrying genetic material from three parents in a bid to avoid children inheriting terrible diseases and also to protect future generations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority gave the green light to the treatment using DNA from three progenitors (two women, one man) to prevent children being born with deadly genetic illnesses, EFE news reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Today's historic decision means that parents at very high risk of having a child with a life-threatening mitochondrial disease may soon have the chance of a healthy, genetically related child,&amp;quot; said HFEA chairwoman Sally Cheshire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The therapy is called &amp;quot;mitochondrial replacement therapy&amp;quot; whereby a mother's egg nucleus with damaged mitochondria is removed and inserted into a donor's egg with healthy mitochondria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, the donor egg with the mother's nucleus is fertilised by the father's sperm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally the fertilised ovum, with the genetic material from both women, donor and mother, is inserted in the mother's womb following standard IVF techniques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some 3,000 women are expected to qualify for the treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitochondria are rod-shaped &amp;quot;engines&amp;quot; that drive human cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They are responsible for energy production and for the regulation of cellular metabolism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A malfunction at this level can provoke innumerable, catastrophic and life-threatening effects in vital organs, muscles, growth, sight, or mental capacity, among others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The British authority approved this controversial measure -- some critics considered the process had been authorised in haste -- to avoid the birth of children suffering from otherwise incurable, hereditary diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The procedure, however, will require prior assessment and licensing by the HFEA of all specialist IVF clinics that wish to offer the treatment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even then, the HFEA will have to authorise each individual case before treatment can proceed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We feel now is the right time to carefully introduce this new treatment in the limited circumstances recommended by the panel,&amp;quot; Cheshire said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is life-changing for those families,&amp;quot; she added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Cairo, Dec 16 (IANS) Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry said on Thursday that traces of explosives were found on the remains of some victims of EgyptAir flight MS804 which crashed over the Mediterranean in May.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Xinhua news agency quoted the Ministry as saying in a press release that the committee investigating the crash will refer the case to the Egyptian general prosecution for the possibility of a criminal act.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The plane went missing from radar screens on May 19 en route from Paris to Cairo and crashed over the Mediterranean some 290 km north of the coastal city of Alexandria, killing 66 people on-board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In July, the investigation committee said the crash was caused by fire on board after decoding the black boxes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Russian airliner crashed over Egypt's Sinai in October of 2015, killing all 224 people on board.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Russia at the time said a bomb attack brought down the passenger jet, while Egypt's President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said publicly that terrorists have been behind the plane crash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sinai-based branch of the regional Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility for the Russian plane crash, which, though, had been strongly refuted by both Egypt and Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>United Nations, Dec 16 (IANS) The United Nations on Friday acknowledged that the world body has been invited to monitor and assist in the evacuation that will take place from the remaining enclave in Aleppo in northern Syria that is controlled by armed opposition groups.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is a three-pronged evacuation: a medical evacuation of wounded and sick, as well as an evacuation of vulnerable civilians and of fighters,&amp;quot; Xinhua news agency quoted UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric as saying at a daily news briefing here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jan Egeland, the UN special adviser on Syria, clarified that this is not an agreement mediated by the United Nations; rather, it is an agreement that has been made in direct talks between the parties to this war, which the United Nations was only invited this morning to monitor.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;That monitoring is happening in conjunction with the International Committee of the Red Cross, who are now present with representatives from the World Health Organisation (WHO),&amp;quot; Dujarric said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The United Nations stands ready with a number of teams that are experts on protection, humanitarian law and humanitarian principles.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UN monitors will accompany those who are being evacuated, not only from east Aleppo but all the way to Idlib, and they also stand ready to care for them all the way into Turkey, if they chose that to be their final destination, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Egeland said that the most painful experience during recent weeks and months is that UN workers have not been able to be present when the Syrian civilians have needed them the most.  He warned that 700,000 people remained in 15 besieged areas beyond east Aleppo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the UN are helping enable the evacuation of the sick and wounded as well as other vulnerable people from eastern Aleppo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;World Health Organisation teams were at the Ramouseh crossing on the south-western edge of the city to monitor the evacuation of sick and wounded people by ambulance. As of 2.40 p.m. local time, the first group of 26 wounded people was medically evacuated to western rural Aleppo, according to ICRC.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was shortly followed by 20 buses and 13 ambulances crossing the frontlines, with people from east Aleppo who were heading westwards, Dujarric said.  &amp;quot;Further evacuations are ongoing.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 16 (IANS) The White House said on Thursday a bill renewing the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) was becoming law without US President Barack Obama's signature.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While calling the extension of the ISA passed almost unanimously by the Congress &amp;quot;unnecessary&amp;quot;, Xinhua news agency quoted the White House as saying in a statement that an extension of the bill &amp;quot;is entirely consistent with&amp;quot; US commitments in the Iran nuclear deal reached in July 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the White House said that Obama declined to sign the bill but let it become law anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Consistent with this longstanding position, the extension of the Iran Sanctions Act is becoming law without the President's signature,&amp;quot; said the statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the US Constitution, if the President takes no action 10 days after the Congress passes a bill, the bill becomes law without the President's signature. However, if the Congress adjourns before the 10 days pass, the bill fails without the signature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Thursday the extension of the ISA would not affect the scope of the sanctions relief Iran is receiving under the Iran unclear deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The administration continues to have all of the necessary authorities to waive the relevant sanctions, with or without the extension of ISA,&amp;quot; said Kerry in a statement, adding that he would continue to sign waivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The surprising move was a direct reversal by the Obama administration after it said earlier that it was expecting that Obama would sign the bill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It also represented the Obama administration's latest efforts to reassure Iran that the US commitment to the nuclear deal would not be affected by the passage of the bill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Islamabad, Dec 16 (IANS) Pakistan suggested to the Afghan government on Thursday to formally invite the Taliban for peace negotiations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The comments came amid reports that Taliban political representatives in Qatar are exploring options for possible talks with the Afghan sides and foreign stakeholders, Xinhua news agency reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The most apt way to move forward in this regard is serious talks between the Afghan government and Taliban. For this, the Afghan government needs to send positive signals to the Taliban inviting them to join the peace process along with necessary incentives,&amp;quot; Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In our view, an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led process is the best way and not the military option,&amp;quot; the spokesman told his weekly briefing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pakistan had facilitated peace talks between the Afghan government and Taliban in July 2015 in the scenic town of Murree near Islamabad. However, the breaking of news of death of the Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omer led to suspension of the talks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We continued our efforts and remained actively engaged in serious efforts through the QCG (Quadrilateral Coordination Group) earlier this year. Again, the killing of Mullah Akhtar Mansoor (in a US drone strike) scuttled the process,&amp;quot; Zakaria said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said Pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the need for a politically negotiated settlement between the Afghan government and Taliban and has continuously endeavoured towards this goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bhubaneswar, Dec 16 (IANS) With the farmers facing hardship due to the demonetisation, the RBI has decided to provide around Rs 70 crore to the District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs) in Odisha on a daily basis to meet the requirement of farmers, said an official on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would provide the money to the DCCBs with regard to crop loan, paddy procurement proceeds and crop insurance claim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking a review meeting on the currency situation in the state, Development Commissioner R.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 16 (IANS) The demonetisation drive, introduction of new regulations such as the Bankruptcy Code and push toward a digital economy could quash fraud and corruption by raising compliance standards even though these moves have had impact on businesses and consumers, according to a report.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forensic Outlook 2017, released by EY Fraud Investigation and Dispute Services on Thursday, has highlighted key trends which will enable companies to enhance compliance, stimulate business growth and redefine the Indian business diaspora.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, the crackdown on bribery and corruption has been through improved reforms such as the recommendations suggested by the Rajya Sabha Committee for the Prevention of Corruption Amendment Bill 2013, demonetisation drive to uncover unaccounted black money, upcoming Goods and Services Tax (GST), Income Disclosure Scheme and many others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2017, the battle against corruption is expected to accelerate as India strives to keep pace with global standards, the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While the short term situation could be challenging, these moves have the ability to quash fraud and corruption, raise compliance standards, focus on individual accountability and increase investor confidence in the long run,&amp;quot; it said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;With cases of fraud and corruption on the rise, companies need to enhance the state of compliance through robust internal controls, due diligence processes and integrity trainings for internal and external stakeholders. The use of technology will be a key factor to strengthen anti-fraud and anti-corruption frameworks and mitigate fraud, waste and abuse,&amp;quot; said Arpinder Singh, Partner and National Leader, Fraud Investigation &amp;amp; Dispute Services, EY India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report said government initiatives, strong domestic demand and rapid inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) led India being on an upward growth trajectory this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bdc/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

It explores relationships like of a businessman couple, a father with his daughter who is going to get married, between a young couple, and also between a maid and her lady boss.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the reason to make a film on this topic, he said: &amp;quot;When this decision was announced, I was sitting with my friends, I thought I can make a film on it. I kept writing and finally it came out very nice. I am not giving any message to (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji. I am just showing the cinematic version of current reality as a filmmaker.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are keeping a special screening of the film on December 21. On December 22, we will release it digitally through our channel,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Change&amp;quot; has been produced by Color 9 Entertainment &amp;amp; Arti Puri. The music is by Sajid-Wajid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;uma/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 15 (IANS) From showing black flags to RBI Governor Urjit Patel, to holding noisy demonstrations outside its office in the city, West Bengal's major non-BJP political parties intensified their protest against demonetisation targeting the apex bank, whose board met in the city on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activists of the Congress threw security personnel into a tizzy, as they staged a noisy black flag demonstration at the NSCBI Airport when Patel was on his way back to Mumbai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At least 20 Congress workers surrounded his car shouting &amp;quot;Urjit Patel hai hai&amp;quot; and waved black flags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Patel got out of the car, the demonstrators went near the official and tried to heckle him, blaming the RBI Governor for the &amp;quot;crisis in the country&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Central Industrial Security Force and West Bengal Police personnel somehow managed to escort Patel to safety inside the airport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Trinamool Congress ministers and state legislators held a sit-in for the second consecutive day in front of the RBI regional office, protesting against insufficient supply of new currency notes in the state, while Patel was attending the apex bank's board meeting inside the building.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several Trinamool supporters along with the party heavyweights shouted slogans and waved black flags at the gate of the Reserve Bank, demanding a roll back of the central government's demonetisation of high-value currency notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's strange what the (RBI) Governor should decide, is being decided by the Prime Minister. Total seven countries tried the demonetisation drive in history and all have failed miserably. What made them think it would be successful in a vast country like India,&amp;quot; said state Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The RBI Governor owes an explanation to the masses for snatching away their democratic rights. We demand an immediate roll-back of this decision,&amp;quot; said Trinamool spokesperson Nirmal Ghosh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Accusing Patel of toeing the central government's political line, the CPI-M led Left Front also held a sit in protest in the morning near RBI's regional office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It seems the RBI governor has been instructed to work according to the views of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the central government. This should not be the state of affairs of an institution like Reserve Bank of India,&amp;quot; said Left Front chairman Biman Bose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mgr/ssp/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 15 (IANS) Attacking the central government over demonetisation, goods transport associations on Thursday declared in unison that the transport industry has suffered a massive setback since the note ban and claimed government's push towards a cashless economy needs serious retrospection.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The transporters stated their support for the government's initiative in curbing the black money but said the industry was taken aback by the abruptness of the decision and is stumbling ever since.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The government should understand every cash driven industry is not equivalent to black money. There is no question of black money in the road transport industry as almost everything related to transportation is paid well in advance,&amp;quot; said Calcutta Goods Transport Association's General Secretary Sunil Agarwal said at an event here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that 40 percent of the freight amount in India is handled in cash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Several transportation aspects like toll taxes, minor repair of vehicles, loading and unloading expenditure, food expenditure of drivers etc have been paid in cash. The government should have given us time to convert to cashless system,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association (FWBTOA) said more than 40 percent of the total goods trucks in the state have stopped plying since the note ban and warned about a complete break-down in the road transportation system if cash flow is not improved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If the vehicle owners were in ICU earlier, the demonitisation has pushed them to a state of coma. Out of 3.70 lakh trucks in the state, 40 percent has already stopped plying. The rest will follow shortly if the situation stays like this,&amp;quot; said FWBTOA's President Subhash Chandra Bose&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He appealed to the government and Reserve Bank of India to increase withdrawal limit to Rs 50,000 for a truck for inter-state transportation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Unlike other industries, the transport industry pays all the taxes well in advance. The road tax, toll tax, fuel tax are all paid, before a goods vehicle hits the road but the industry is not getting any relaxations in terms of cash withdrawals from the government,&amp;quot; he complained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Describing the goods transport industry as the 'blood line of the nation', Prabhat K Mittal, the president of CGTA, suggested the government should eradicate the instances of corruption and use improved infrastructure to make the industry cashless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Government should take practical decisions like abolishing toll tax at least for a month as toll cards at many plazas are not working. We are also proposed to pay toll tax in advance for vehicles with national permit,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mgr/bdc/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a plea by Justice Markandey Katju (retd) challenging a resolution passed by Parliament deploring his remarks against Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dismissing the plea by the former top court judge, a bench of Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Justice Uday Umesh Lalit said that the&amp;quot;freedom of speech in Parliament&amp;quot; is absolute and unfettered and subject only to such of the provisions of the Constitution which relate to regulation of procedure in Parliament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Parliament had condemned Justice Katju for calling Gandhi a British agent and Bose a Japanese agent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Justice Katju had contended that parliament condemned him without giving him a hearing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking for the bench, Justice Lalit said: &amp;quot;It is not as if any action was deliberately undertaken or sanction was issued against the petitioner (Justice Katju). The petitioner (Justice Katju) in exercise of his right under Article 19(a) made certain statements concerning two famous personalities.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are not for a moment suggesting that he could not or ought not to have made those statements. He is entitled to his views and put those views in public domain for consumption of public in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The response by both Houses of Parliament was also natural in that the Resolutions in question dealt with his statements in public domain. All that the resolutions did was to condemn his remarks and did not refer to the conduct or character of the petitioner.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It further noted that that the remarks made by Justice Katju regarding Gandhi and Bose, which were in public domain, were &amp;quot;touching subject of general public interest and as such could well be discussed in the Houses&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rajya Sabha by a resolution passed on March 11, 2015 said: &amp;quot;This House expresses its unequivocal condemnation of the recent remarks of the former judge of the Supreme Court, Shri Justice Markandey Katju, against the Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army for the freedom of the country.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next day on March 12, 2015, Lok Sabha by another resolution condemned Justice Katju.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The resolution read &amp;quot;Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Shri Subhash Chandra Bose both are venerated by the entire country. The contribution of these two great personalities to the freedom struggle of the country and their dedication is unparalleled. The statement given by the former Judge of Supreme Court and former Chairman of Press Council of India Shri Markandey Katju is deplorable. This House unequivocally condemns the statement given by former Judge of Supreme Court Shri Markandey Katju unanimously.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the court rejected the Centre's plea that Justice Katju's petition was not maintainable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pk/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 15 (IANS) US President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday questioned the probe into election-related hacking that is allegedly linked to Moscow, hinting the White House only bothered to look into the matter now that Trump has won.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?&amp;quot; Xinhua news agency cited a tweet by Trump.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;White House spokesman Josh Earnest admitted Wednesday that the President had known about the hackings prior to the election, but refrained from acting on it to avoid being seen as &amp;quot;meddler in the election&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The New York Times reported on Wednesday that hacker groups linked to the Russian government have been actively trying to obtain information from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) since 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump's rant can be seen as deep rift between Trump and the establishment regarding their stance on Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The nomination of Rex Tillerson on Tuesday as the Secretary of State faces potential hurdles in the Congress with members of Trump's own Republican Party threatening to vote 'no'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I can't imagine I would vote for anybody that believes that we should not sanction Russia given that they did, in fact, interfere in our election,&amp;quot; said Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vgu/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed authorities concerned to map areas in the national capital that are the leading polluters of environment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court directive came after the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) told it that stubble burning in Punjab had put about 9,000 tonnes of PM 2.5 particulate matter in air in October and November, leading to severe pollution in the city. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CPCB said burning of one tonne of dry paddy straw produces about 0.672 kg of PM 2.5 and 0.747 kg of PM 10, which do not dissipate easily from the environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every year, between October and November, Punjab farmers burn approximately 14 million tonnes of paddy straw, the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A division bench of Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Ashutosh Kumar termed the figures &amp;quot;alarming&amp;quot; and said an effective way to reduce air pollutants was to have more green cover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stubble burning in Punjab has been blamed for air pollution in several parts of north India, particularly Delhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court said it wanted the figure for the average ambient air quality for Delhi by excluding the figures from Anand Vihar, which recorded the highest air pollution level in Delhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) said Anand Vihar's high pollution level was due to the presence of a railway station, an inter-state bus terminal and chaotic traffic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court directed Delhi Traffic Police to rectify and rationalise the movement of traffic in the area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court posted the matter for further hearing on January 12, 2017. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court is hearing public interest litigation against increasing air pollution in Delhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS &lt;br&gt;gt/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

We in Tech Mahindra have been particularly strong because we're strong both in communications and IT, which places us in a good position to take advantage of these new technologies,&amp;quot; Yargop said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The tech sector has benefited from demonetisation.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Itanagar, Dec 15 (IANS) Northeast state Arunachal Pradesh's tranquil village Dambuk, known for its orange orchards, came to life with the roaring sound of modified Gypsies and Jeeps and the high octane rock music as the third edition of Orange Festival of Adventure &amp;amp; Music began on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The JK Tyre Orange 4x4 Fury off-roading event, which is part of the four-day fest, was flagged off in Dambuk amidst motor sports enthusiasts who cheered for their favourite team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A total of seven teams are participating in the off-roading event, making up to 28 participants, but only three teams managed to complete the first stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a special category for participants from the northeast. They are participating as individuals with two members, making up a team in one car.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gerrari Offroaders from Chandigarh maintained their supremacy after stage one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The four-member team, comprising two cars each, was led by drivers Sanbir Dhaliwal and Padam Chauhan. They were assisted by co-drivers Gurpartap Singh and Maneet Sandhu, as they manoeuvred past one 10-foot long pit after using two long planks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It was game of coordination between the drivers, the co-drivers and the machines. We couldn't afford to make a single mistake as the entry points into and the exit points from the pits were also very tough,&amp;quot; Dhaliwal said here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three pits were lined up next to each other, and the team had to drag the same heavy planks to get past all the pits. In all, there were eight obstacles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They overcame the obstacles in 10.41 minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With more stages left, one can expect a lot more action and thrill in the next two days. The champions of this edition will be announced on Saturday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The powerful sound of the machines was complemented by the beats of rock numbers, played by some of the bands at the fest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The evening saw performances by The Baby Boomers - the first western style band in Bhutan, Kolkata-based funk alternative rock band GingerFeet, popular Delhi rock band Menwhopause, Sky Level from Shillong, singer Antoine from France and American act Scott Moses Murray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supported by Arunachal Pradesh Tourism department, the fest will be headlined by Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are more high adrenaline adventure sports like river rafting, dirt cycling and ATV rides in the forests that one can enjoy. And of course, the food stalls that are mostly offering chicken and pork dishes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The writer's trip to Arunachal Pradesh is sponsored by JK Tyre Motorsports.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Ahmedabad, Dec 15 (IANS) Over 100 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers were on Thursday detained outside the Gujarat High Court for staging a demonstration ahead of a hearing on a petition on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's academic degrees.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nearly 200 workers protested outside the Gujarat High Court compound, shouted slogans and displayed placards, demanding the details of Modi's degrees be made public. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Police dispersed the party workers and detained nearly 100 of them, including senior party leader Kanu Kalsaria,&amp;quot; the AAP Gujarat unit said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The police said the detained AAP workers were released later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The AAP workers assembled at the High Court before the hearing of a case related to Modi's degree obtained from the Gujarat University (GU). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A petition was filed by the Gujarat University against a Central Information Commission (CIC) order to reveal the details on the degree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On April 29, the CIC directed the Delhi University and the Gujarat University to provide information to Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal on the degrees earned by Modi in 1978 (graduation from DU) and 1983 (postgraduation from GU). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In July, the Gujarat High Court put on hold the CIC's order that directed the GU to provide information on Modi's degree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo had written a letter to the Information Commissioner asking for reason for alleged concealment of details related to Modi's educational qualifications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The letter was treated as an RTI application and subsequently the GU and DU authorities were asked to provide the details. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In response to the CIC's directive, GU Vice Chancellor M.N. Patel divulged that Modi got a Master of Arts degree in Political Science. He was enrolled as an external student of the GU and obtained the degree in 1983, Patel said while expressing the inability to share the marksheet as the varsity cannot provide details of records beyond two decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;desai/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Civil Society members condemned the Union  government's move to reject the FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) renewal applications of 25 non-government organisations (NGO) on Thursday. The members alleged that the government used FCRA &amp;quot;as a tool of repression&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The state is following a systematic and sustained agenda of suppressing those very dissenting voices that have consistently challenged the system. The current FCRA registration refusals are the most immediate example of this escalating problem, whereby the government maligns and criminalises those very organisations and individuals that stand for human rights and liberal values,&amp;quot; reads a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The civil society members include historian Ramchandra Guha, social activist Aruna Roy, anti-child labour activist Shantha Sinha, and wildlife biologist Ravi Chellam, who is attached to Greenpeace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the statement, news media reports suggested that Lawyers Collective, Compassion East India, Centre for Promotion of Social Concerns (People's Watch), Sanchal Foundation Hazards Centre, Indian Social Action Forum (INSAF) and Institute of Public Health (Bengaluru) were among those 25 NGOs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The members said that the few notices, issued by the government, were found to be &amp;quot;worded such that they can hardly be deemed legally or procedurally valid&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Cancellation of an organisation's FCRA registration by citing a reason as vaguely termed as 'on the basis of field agency reports' is arbitrary and unacceptable. The MHA has also suggested that these organisations are working against 'national interest',&amp;quot; the statement read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The right to dissent, one of the cornerstones of a healthy democracy, has been haunted by this spectre of anti-nationalism, creating a political climate where dissent warrants swift retribution,&amp;quot; it asserted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The members said that they stood in solidarity with these 25 organisations and demanded that these cancellations be revoked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We also demand a revoking of the FCRA itself as a draconian and repressive law that not only lends itself to being a state-operated repressive tool, but is also in violation of the global human right to freedom of association,&amp;quot; the statement quoted the members as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;spk/vgu/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a plea by an IAF personnel seeking to grow a beard and said that the IAF's policies on personal appearance were not intended to discriminate against religious beliefs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Regulation and policies in regard to personal appearances are not intended to discriminate against religious beliefs, nor do they have the affect of doing so,&amp;quot; a bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice L. Nageswara Rao said while rejecting the plea by Mohammed Zubair.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zubair, who joined the Indian Air Force on December 19, 2001, has since been discharged from service. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zubair had on January 10, 2005, applied for permission to sport a beard but the plea was rejected by the Air Officer Commanding. He subsequently challenged in the court the directions to shave off his beard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Their (regulation and policies) object and purpose is to ensure uniformity, cohesiveness, discipline and order which are indispensable to the Air Force, as indeed to every armed force,&amp;quot; the ruling said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking for the bench, Justice Chandrachud said: &amp;quot;India is a secular nation in which every religion must be treated with equality. In the context of the Armed Forces, which comprise men and women following a multitude of faiths, the needs of secular India are accommodated by recognising the right of worship and by respecting religious beliefs.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Yet, in a constitutional sense, it cannot be overlooked that the overarching necessity of a force -- which has been raised to protect the nation -- is to maintain discipline,&amp;quot; the judgment said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is why, the court said, &amp;quot;the Constitution in the provisions of Article 33 stipulates that Parliament may by law determine to what extent the Fundamental Rights ... shall stand restricted or abrogated in relation inter alia to the members of the Armed Forces so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The petitioner had moved the apex court to challenge the Punjab and Haryana High Court judgment that held that maintaining a beard was not an integral part of the religion professed by him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The High Court further held that the matter pertained to the Armed Forces, where a certain degree of discipline had to be maintained, and that the rules and regulations broadly accommodate &amp;quot;the basic interest of various religions in a secular manner&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pk/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Even after over a month of demonetisation, cash starved people continued to queue up outside banks and ATM kiosks on Thursday while the Union government said it was focusing on printing new Rs 500 notes to ease the liquidity situation over the next 2-3 weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Continuing the crackdown on black money, the Income Tax Department raided two branches of a private bank in the national capital region unearthing 20 fake accounts while officials recovered Rs 10 crore from several lockers of a bank in Pune. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serpentine queues at banks and ATM kiosks have become a daily affair since the Narendra Modi government's November 8 decision to spike high-value currency notes. There was no change in the routine across the national capital as people from all walks of life endeavoured to lay hands on much needed cash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were also altercations among the customers and officials after some of the bank branches ran out of money. Many customers complained that they were never informed if there was any cash left or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In what may be a respite for the masses, the Finance Ministry on the day said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was now focusing on printing of Rs 500 notes which would ease the liquidity situation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In 2-3 weeks, the situation will ease out because of the focus on printing of Rs 500 notes,&amp;quot; Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told media persons here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das also clarified that the government has no intention of printing new notes worth the entire Rs 15.44 lakh crore, that were in circulation in high denomination notes before demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The remonetisation will be as per requirement. There is no target that we have to reach (print) Rs 15 lakh crore,&amp;quot; he said, adding that by December-end, the government would have put about 50 percent of Rs 15.44 lakh crore in circulation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das said that initially the focus was to supply enough Rs 2,000 notes so as to replenish the demonetised notes as soon as possible. He also said that large amount of seized notes will also be put back in circulation as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said the process of distribution has been further streamlined with printing presses being linked to distribution areas nearer to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For making adequate cash available in the rural areas, cooperative banks have been given enough money to provide for crop loans, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das said that out of 2.20 lakh ATMs, over two lakh have already been recalibrated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raiding the Axis Bank branch in Noida's Sector 51, IT official seized 20 fake accounts with deposits amounting Rs 60 crore. The Connaught Place branch of the bank was also raided by the department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The twin raids came days after another branch of the bank in  Delhi's Chandni Chowk area was raided and 44 fake accounts with Rs 100 crore unearthed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said managing demonetisation was a short-term challenge for the next few weeks and months and asserted the Indian economy is &amp;quot;very stable&amp;quot; at the macro level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;One of the challenges for the Indian economy in the short-term is to manage the demonetisation fall-out. How do we manage demonetisation in the next few weeks and months,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day also saw the government launch two incentive schemes for both consumers and merchants to boost digital payments.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Announcing the twin schemes, Niti Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant said the objective was to make digital payments a &amp;quot;mass movement&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Lucky Grahak Yojana would reward consumers through a daily as well as a weekly draw on transactions worth Rs 50 to Rs 3,000, with a maximum reward up to Rs 1 lakh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana, meant for merchants, would have a maximum reward of Rs 50,000, Kant said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The schemes would commence from December 25, Christmas Day, and would conclude on April 14 -- the birth anniversary of Bhimrao Ambedkar -- next year with mega awards, Kant said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;and/vd/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Supreme Court on Thursday asked the government to spell out its norms and ratio for the disbursement of new currency notes to the banks and other financial institutions holding the public deposits as it observed that some people have plenty and other none.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You have to have norms that should apply to all across the board,&amp;quot; said the bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud, pointing out that if district co-operative banks will not get new currency in return of the defunct currency they have deposited, how will they continue with their operations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If you receive Rs 1,000 crore of old currency notes (from a bank or a co-operative society operating under NABARD), how much of that will you return? You say not immediately. What is the time frame? First month, second month, you stagger the payments,&amp;quot; said Chief Justice Thakur as government tried to skirt the question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said this, the court reserved its order for interim direction for hearing on the challenge to the legality of demonetisation decision, whether matter is to be referred to a larger bench, questions to be addressed and the threshold limit on withdrawals by the account holders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As court said that &amp;quot;there has to be a ration, you must have a policy&amp;quot;, Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi said: &amp;quot;There are dynamics that work. A bank may deposit more money, but may not need amount equal to what it has deposited.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Defending the government's demonetisation decision, he said: &amp;quot;The country is facing a revolution to clean the slush money of 70 years. This is not a case of dispossession. Some initiatives have been taken.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Irrespective of posers from the bench or from the counsel appearing for the petitioners challenging demonetisation, the government stuck to one line that there were 7.5 lakh crore of currency notes in the market (five lakh crores of new denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 and 2.5 lakh crores of the denomination of Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 50 and Rs 100.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coupled with this, Attorney General repeatedly told the court that all the woes on account of rationing were for another 14 days as the last date for rationing of currency notes ends on December 31.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of the petitioners, said: &amp;quot;He says it is only 14 days. What will happen after December 31. People don't have money for meeting their basic needs and to pay the school fees of their children.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Repeating his earlier argument, Rohatgi said those affected by the demonetisation like the common man, farmers and others were not coming to the court and it were just the lawyers who were agitating before the court.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he again repeated that there were Rs. 7.5 lakh crores in the circulation, the court asked: &amp;quot;How are people getting crores of new currency notes (obviously pointing to seizure of new currency notes worth crores), therte ard people who nothing.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Some have plenty, others have nothing,&amp;quot; the bench observed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Urging the court to direct the government not to destroy the old currency notes, counsel Prashant Bhushan told the court that problem is that they don't have the new currency notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another counsel disputed the figures of notes given by the government saying that they are &amp;quot;totally false&amp;quot; and contending that the government &amp;quot;can't do it (replace the notes) even in two years&amp;quot;. He also pointed to the death of 96 people who had allegedly collapsed standing in long queues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pk/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Dubai, Dec 15 (IANS) Indian star shuttler P.V. Sindhu lost her second match of the Group B of the BWF Superseries Finals to Chinese Sun Yu here on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rio Olympic Games 2016 silver medallist Sindhu went down 15-21, 17-21 against World No.6 Sun at the Hamdan Sports Complex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This loss has jeopardised Sindhu's chances of qualification to the semi-finals. The 22-year-old Indian had beaten Akane Yamaguchi of Japan in the opener and now, after this loss, she faces a huge task of overcoming reigning world and Olympic champion Carolina Marin of Spain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She must win the third game against the ruthless Spaniard, the oppoenent who defeated her in the Rio Games title showdown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the game against Sun, Sindhu lacked sharpness and that reflected in her poor challenges to the Chinese's delectable drop shots and half smashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sindhu trailed from the beginning and never managed to equalise. At the beginning, she was trailing 3-7 and the best she managed to bridge the gap was at 8-10. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Sun ran away with four straight points to stand at 14-8 before dropping a point and then again notching six points to be at 20-9.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sindhu tried to delay the inevitable as she registered six straight points. But it was only a matter of point for Sun and the Chinese sealed the game at 21-15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second though, Sindhu improved her game and fought for each point against Sun. But the Chinese was clearly the better player. She took a 5-2 lead but Sindhu equalised at five-point mark.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Afterwards, Sun led and Sindhu was always trailing. The Indian trailed until the 15-point mark where she equalised but Sun was determined to finish the match in the second game. Sindhu gave fight for only two more points and conceded the game 17-21.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pur/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Gandhinagar, Dec 15 (IANS) The Gujarat government on Thursday approved an ordinance to ban hookah bars across the state. The decision was taken at a meeting of the State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;From today, it will be a cognisable offence to operate a hookah bar in the state. The penalty for running the bar would be imprisonment of one to three years and fine between Rs 20,000 and Rs 50,000,&amp;quot; state Home Minister Pradipsinh Jadeja told rporters here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Gujarat Police had earlier forced several hookah bars across the state to shut down over the issue of license. However, the hookah bar owners challenged the action in the courts, which ruled in their favour. After this, the bars re-opened and many more  mushroomed in several cities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jadeja said the government had brought in the provision because many youngsters were falling prey to the habit and getting into debt. &amp;quot;Eventually some of them got involved in anti-social behaviour. It became a matter of concern.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;desai/vgu/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar on Thursday held the Congress responsible for the Parliament impasse and said the opposition party did not want to debate demonetisation in both the houses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;From Day One, they pursued a confused and disjointed strategy in both the houses. In the Rajya Sabha, where their numbers are more, they did not have any condition for the debate on the first day. In the Lok Sabha, where their numbers are less, they wanted a voting,&amp;quot; Ananth Kumar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The whole debate was lost to the myopic strategy of the Congress leadership and its Vice-President Rahul Gandhi...&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There was a lot for the government to say and a lot of things for the oppostition to raise, criticise and analyse,&amp;quot; the minister said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another senior minister, on the condition of anonymity, blamed the Congress Vice-President for &amp;quot;gagging&amp;quot; Parliament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In every BAC (Business Advisory Committee) meeting, time was allocated for bills, for the supplementary demand for grants and other topics. But the opposition did not let the house function. Rahul Gandhi is the mastermind behind the gagging of Parliament; the only other time it has happened was in 1975-76,&amp;quot; the minister said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government, meanwhile, is hopeful of getting the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill, 2014, passed in the Lok Sabha on Friday, with the opposition giving &amp;quot;positive signals&amp;quot; towards this end, informed sources said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Friday is the last day of the winter session, which began on November 16, and the signals from both the government and opposition sides indicate that Parliament may not function properly, just as was the case with the rest of the session.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The winter session of Parliament is headed for a washout due to continued disruptions over demonetisation and other issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ao/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The government on Thursday accepted the possibility of double-counting of the deposits received in the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes by the banking system, and added that the verification process is on.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We think there is scope of double counting, so the verification is continuing,&amp;quot; Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told reporters here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have identified areas where double counting could have been possible. The banks are checking and re-checking to see there is double counting of figures,&amp;quot; Das added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The possibility of double-counting of deposits was fuelled in wake of huge deposit figures being quoted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;RBI had earlier reported that Rs 12.44 lakh crore of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes have been deposited till December 10 by the public since the demonetisation announced on November 8. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government had earlier said the total amount of high denomination currency circulating in the system on November 8 - the day of demonetisation - was Rs 15.44 lakh crore or $225 billion (Rs 8.58 lakh crore in Rs 500 notes and Rs 6.86 lakh crore in Rs 1,000).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With still a fortnight remaining for the people to deposit their cash in old notes, it is thus being widely expected that the reported amount will exceed way beyond the Rs 15.44 lakh crore, as an outcome of double-counting by the banks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mm/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The &amp;quot;surgical strike&amp;quot; of demonetisation on black money and corruption has turned out to be a fiasco &amp;quot;coupled with a scam on an industrial scale&amp;quot;, the CPI-M has said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An editorial in the party journal &amp;quot;People's Democracy&amp;quot; said that 36 days after the withdrawal of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes, ordinary people were struggling to get meagre amounts of cash from their own bank accounts or ATMs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Long queues and endless wait outside banks and ATMs continue. There is no cash available for those who need it the most - the casual labourer, the vegetable vendor, the domestic worker and the whole workforce involved in the informal economy,&amp;quot; it said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Communist Party of India-Marxist, however, pointed out that at the same time, large amounts of new notes were being found in the hands of businessmen, hawala operators, politicians and corrupt bureaucrats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The last two weeks have seen income tax raids which have uncovered huge amounts of unaccounted money and that too in brand new 2,000 rupee notes...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;According to one estimate, around Rs 160 crore of new notes were seized from all over the country up to December 12 and this is only the tip of the iceberg.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The editorial went on: &amp;quot;What we are witnessing is a money laundering operation on a grand scale. Instead of curbing black money, what (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi's demonetisation has achieved is to get large amounts of black money converted into white money. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It has opened new avenues of corruption in the financial system. Corrupt bank officials are conniving with money launderers to make the exchange of notes a large-scale scam. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government has been clueless on how to check this money laundering through the banks using various devices.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It said the &amp;quot;cashless economy&amp;quot; slogan was being pushed to cover up the fact that the government had miserably failed to produce adequate amounts of new currency notes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The 'cashless' drive is thus a bid to divert attention from the currency disaster facing the country.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mr/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday stressed the necessity of educating women, providing them economic independence, and legal rights and social awareness for their empowerment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The President expressed his views while meeting a delegation from Young FICCI Ladies Organisation (YFLO) at Rashtrapati Bhavan.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Speaking on the occasion, Mukherjee congratulated the YFLO for its enthusiasm and encouragement to an important cause and said &amp;quot;a society which cannot respect women cannot be called a civilised society&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Outlining the steps to empower women, he said the first and foremost necessity was education of women, which would help them to understand their problems and develop in them consciousness to look for solutions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He mentioned economic independence as the second necessity to make women independent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;On many occasions, the economic value of the contribution of women is not highlighted. The contribution of women is also not highlighted through services which are not accounted for in economic terms. This should be changed,&amp;quot; the President said.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He described legal rights granted to women through various laws as the third aspect which is important for their empowerment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mukherjee said that creation of social awareness in this regard, is the fourth necessity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The need was for involvement of all sections of society in order to sensitize people to give women their due and empower them. It was necessary to change the mental frame and do away with prejudices,&amp;quot; he said.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The President also emphasised that it was necessary to avoid &amp;quot;tokenism&amp;quot;, and said that though this may seem like a long and arduous journey but success could be achieved through commitment and sustained efforts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rak/vgu/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) For years, the world of showbiz has set popular benchmarks for love and romance. But away from the reel, real life love stories went sour for multiple celebrity couples across the Bollywood and Hollywood circuit in 2016, which also interestingly brought in Hindi cinema\'s very own \&amp;quot;Breakup song\&amp;quot;.
&lt;p&gt;Their personal lives hogged limelight through the gossip columns and had the social media world buzzing. IANS has compiled a mix of splits that left fans and fraternity members wonder about what went wrong:

* Actor-filmmaker Farhan Akhtar and celebrity hairstylist Adhuna Bhabani: They called it quits after 16 years of marriage, announcing that they had \&amp;quot;mutually and amicably decided to separate\&amp;quot;. It was not revealed why the parents of two children -- Akira and Shakya -- decided to split, but several rumours indicated that an actress could have been home-breaker for this love saga.

* Actor-filmmaker Arbaaz Khan and actress Malaika Arora: The speculation about tensions between the couple had been on for a while, but it was in March that Arbaaz and Malaika decided to announce that they were on a \&amp;quot;break\&amp;quot;. And in November, they applied for divorce -- just months after they co-hosted \&amp;quot;Power Couple\&amp;quot;, a reality TV show based on love and positivity.

Together, Arbaaz and Malaika, who got married in 1997, and always complemented each other with their looks, have a 14-year-old son named Arhaan.

* Actors Sushant Singh Rajput and Ankita Lokhande: He made the girl go weak in the knees when he proposed to her on one knee on national television. But alas, the love story didn\'t last long.

Having made their acting debut in 2009 with the TV show \&amp;quot;Pavitra Rishta\&amp;quot;, Sushant and Ankita were quickly pronounced one of best looking TV couples at one point of time. He was offered \&amp;quot;Kai Po Che!\&amp;quot;, which put him on a roll in Bollywood, reportedly taking a toll on his relationship with Ankita, who is also said to have been insecure.

After a six-year long romance, Sushant had announced in January 2016 that he would tie the knot with Ankita by the end of this year. But their relationship took another course.

* Actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: Labelled as the split of all splits of 2016, the Brangelina breakup rocked the entertainment world like none other, leaving their fans heartbroken. Jolie cited \&amp;quot;irreconcilable differences\&amp;quot; as the grounds for the divorce, while Pitt released a statement of his own to People magazine saying: \&amp;quot;I am very saddened by this, but what matters most now is the well-being of our kids.\&amp;quot;

The two got together in 2004 after starring in \&amp;quot;Mr &amp;amp; Mrs Smith\&amp;quot;, leading to the latter\'s split from \&amp;quot;Friends\&amp;quot; star Jennifer Aniston. They got married in 2014 in France, and have six children together.

* Actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: This was one split which got a tad ugly with actress Heard\'s allegation that she was physically and verbally abused by Depp throughout their relationship. She divorced the \&amp;quot;Pirates of the Caribbean\&amp;quot; star in May.

Their love saga began with their meeting on the set of \&amp;quot;The Rum Diary\&amp;quot; in 2009, and they started dating in 2012. It was in February 2015 that they exchanged wedding vows, but sources close to the couple said their fights began within three months.

* Actor Pulkit Samrat and Shweta Rohira: \&amp;quot;Fukrey\&amp;quot; actor Pulkit Samrat\'s split with Salman Khan\'s \'Rakhi sister\' Shweta Rohira, could also be counted among splits that caught the attention this year -- given the \&amp;quot;Dabangg\&amp;quot; star\'s connect.

The split came two years after their marriage, and blamed for the split was Pulkit\'s \&amp;quot;Sanam Re\&amp;quot; and \&amp;quot;Junooniyat\&amp;quot; co-star Yami Gautam. However, the truth of the matter remains a mystery.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Lucknow, Dec 15 (IANS) Home favourites India overcame Spain 2-1 to set up a semi-final clash against Australia in the Hockey Junior World Cup at the Major Dhyan Chand Stadium here on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marc Serrahima's successful penalty conversion had given Spain a 1-0 lead in the 22nd minute. But India fought back in the second half with penalty corner conversions from Simranjeet Singh (57th) and Harmanpreet Singh (66th) to march into the last four stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After this win, Harendra Singh-coached India will face the task of going past Australia, who got the better of European powerhouse the Netherlands 2-1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time India reached the semi-final of the tournament was in 2005 in Rotterdam. They had finished fourth then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other semi-final will be played between double defending champion Germany and Belgium. While Germany eased past England 4-2, Belgium edged past Argentina 4-1 (1-1) via penalty shoot-out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The match between India and Spain turned out to be a tough fight and the European team stifled the hosts with strong man-to-man marking. Spain curbed India's flair and managed to keep them at bay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India got a couple of penalty corners but due to technical flaws like poor trapping and bad execution, they were not fruitful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spain, meanwhile took the lead after earning a penalty corner in the 22nd minute. Serrahima's powerful flick to the right low corner beat Indian goalkeeper Vikash Dahiya to give Spain a 1-0 lead, much to the frustration of the decent crowd in attendance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spain managed to keep their lead till the half-time and in the second half, it seemed the equaliser was difficult to come by as the Indians kept making a mess of penalty corner opportunities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the 57th minute, it changed. Even though it was a poorly executed penalty corner, Sumit managed to hit a powerful blow straight at the Spanish goalkeeper Albert Perez, who blocked it before the ball popped out. Simranjeet tapped the ball in quickly before the goalkeeper could react to make it 1-1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the equaliser, the confidence of the Indians grew and with the crowd behind them, they pushed hard for the lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nine minutes later, Harmanpreet made amends for his earlier mistakes to fire a grounder past Perez to make it 2-1 as the crowd erupted in joy. The strike marked the third goal for Harmanpreet, who was being criticised for his poor penalty corner conversions in the 16-nation tournament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pur/bg&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 15 (IANS) Expressing serious concern over alleged political discrimination among states, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday wrote to RBI Governor Urjit Patel to know &amp;quot;the nature of allocation of new currency&amp;quot; to each state.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Banerjee also asked the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor to come out with a solution so that the common people get relief from hardships following demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In her letter to the RBI chief, Banerjee said: &amp;quot;We would like to know from you the nature of allocation of new currency to each of the states in a spirit of transparency and accountability, since there are serious concerns of political discrimination amongst states.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, ... we expect you to stand up against this demonetisation onslaught against the common people of the nation at this moment of crisis, rather than falling silent and remaining opaque.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patel held an hour-long meeting with Banerjee and the West Bengal  government officials at the state Secretariat Nabanna after the apex bank's Central Board met here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chief Minister described the meeting with Patel as &amp;quot;positive&amp;quot; and said she was able to put forth her views to the RBI Governor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;He heard what I have said. What was there to answer? I have expressed the views of the common people. I have raised all the pertinent points with requisite documents and evidences.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It was a positive meeting to express our concerns. I got an opportunity to meet the man who was involved in demonetisation. I was able to give my views and expressions on behalf of the commoners,&amp;quot; Banerjee said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chief Minister claimed in the letter that the country was going through unprecedented misery and suffering due to &amp;quot;cruel misadventure of demonetisation&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have said that you should come out with a solution. We respect the RBI as an institution, which should not be used or misused politically. The RBI must stand up and give relief to the people from the hardship they are facing,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister, not by him (RBI Governor) which was technically wrong,&amp;quot; she contended.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The letter claimed that already five crore workers in various sectors across the country were facing unemployment and hunger, and that the unorganised sector -- which provides two-thirds of the jobs -- has &amp;quot;literally collapsed&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The small and medium enterprises are shutting down in lakhs. The farmers are going through trauma due to man-made disaster of massive demonetisation,&amp;quot; said Banerjee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The West Bengal Chief Minister said even middle and larger industries have cut down on their production by at least 50 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Banerjee has been attacking the RBI for the way demonetisation of high-value currency notes has been implemented.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Criticising Patel's silence on the issue, she called upon the Centre and the RBI to extend a helping hand to tea garden workers who, she alleged, were dying in the aftermath of demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The letter said the economy was getting derailed and gross domestic product growth rates were being revised down every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Banerjee, demonetisation has affected implementation of Goods and Service Tax as the state's earnings have dropped by 25 per cent due to the scrapping of high-denomination currency notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bdc/ssp/tsb&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Convnetional wisdom has it that while wine is to be paired with white meat and red wine with red wine. Correct? &amp;quot;Not so,&amp;quot; asserts sommlier Prateek Arora.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Pair a pork cooked with sage with a white wine and you get a blast of tastes,&amp;quot; Arora told IANS at a Wine and Dine outing at the Mehrauli swish Qla fine diner here on Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He then went a step further.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Contrary to conventional wisdom, Indian foods and wine can be a great marriage bur certain tweaks are required to the food, The melange of spices makes this possible,&amp;quot; Arora, a Qla director, who plays the guitar to unwind and who was named Sommlier of the Year at the recent delWine Excellance Awards, explained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But to begin at the beginning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Welcome to the chemistry lab,&amp;quot; Arora proclaimed as the guests moved into the vast bar after a rather unusual, but refreshing welcome drink - sparkling wine witn passion fruit puree and dehydrated pine apple - served in the courtyard of the 100-cover eatery, equally divided between the inside and the outside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;To truly appreciate wine, you have to first unlearn what you know. You've gotta see if the wine talks to you. So, smell, agitate the wine and then slip slowly. Wine is all about awakening your senses,&amp;quot; he explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Wine is like a little baby trapped in a bottle. The moment the bottle opens, you are bringing out its best. Look at it, swirl it and see what it does to your nose. Taste it and it tells you what it is all about on your palette. It'll create perception areas on your tongue,&amp;quot; Arora elaborated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was then time for the first of the pairings, a delicate gougeres light pastry made with three different types of cheese and chilli flakes. What the white wine did was to enhance the flavours of the cheese and sharpen the impact of the chilli flakes. Quite a combination!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was then time to move into the kitchen where Chef Priyam Chatterjee, who was born into a family where feasts and thriving on culinary traditions were a daily deal, deftly cooked up an appetiser using shimiji mushrooms, butter, grated cheese and a variety of herbs with a generous portion of white wine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was then time for the sit-down part of the evening over a vegetrian white sauce risotto and (vegetarian/non-vegetarian red sauce pasta - served in tandem with a white an a red wine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That proved quite a momement as the red wine, which went down smoothly when sipped independently, tasted a mite sweet when combined with the two dishes - proof of wine creating &amp;quot;perception areas&amp;quot; on the tongue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I'm absolutely passionate about wine,&amp;quot; said Arora, who explained that he uses his wine palate to deconstruct and construct drinks to do justice to each ingredient which, according to him, should shine through in what a guest gets in the glass. For him, each of the parts is as important as the whole.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And this is what prompted him to lauch the Wednesday Wine Evening at Qla once a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We choose the dates with care to ensure they don't clash with anything important. We want our guests to spend a quiet evening and not get hassled about being caught in traffic or any other eventuality,&amp;quot; Arora concluded. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Vishnu Makhijani visited Qla at the reataurant's invitation. He can be contacted at vishnu.makhijani@ians.in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Parliament's winter session -- which ends on December 16 -- is headed for a virtual washout as chaos reigned in both houses on Thursday, the penultimate day of the month-long session.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Members of both the opposition and treasury benches indulged in recrimination over demonetisation, corruption and other issues. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Lok Sabha, the opposition pressed for a debate on demonetisation while the treasury benches demanded a discussion on the AgustaWestland helicopter deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The continued disruption in both the houses angered veteran Bharatiya Janata Party leader and Lok Sabha member L.K. Advani, who said he feels like resigning from Parliament because of unending pandemonium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He asked Home Minister Rajnath Singh to convey to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan that she should ensure that the house functions on Friday to discuss the November 8 demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Lok Sabha, both opposition and treasury benches shouted at each other as Speaker Sumitra Mahajan warned the members against displaying newspapers in the house. She then adjourned the house  till noon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The opposition accused the Bharatiya Janata Party members of obstructing the debate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader A.P. Jithender Reddy said he should be allowed to speak as he had started the discussion on demonetisation under Rule 193.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Every party has a problem with the implementation of demonetisation... I was not allowed to speak,&amp;quot; Reddy said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay said, &amp;quot;There is one more day left before the end of the session. A discussion could have been initiated, without any rules.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parliamentary Affairs Minister H.N. Ananth Kumar raised the issue of the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal and said names of certain Congress leaders are mentioned in middleman Christian Michel's diary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This further irked the opposition members, leading to more ruckus, following which Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the house for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even after the Lok Sabha was adjourned, Advani remained seated while other members left the house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the media gallery, Advani was heard telling Rajnath Singh to convey to the Speaker that she should ensure the house runs on Friday to discuss demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advani was then joined by Trinamool Congress MP Idris Ali, who later told reporters that he asked after the former Deputy Prime Minister's health, to which the latter quipped: &amp;quot;My health is fine but the health of Parliament is not.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I feel like resigning,&amp;quot; said Advani, his comments audible to those present in the media gallery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Idris then asked Advani about Vajpayee's health. Advani replied: &amp;quot;He would have been very sad to see this.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If the situation is the same on the last day as well, Parliament will be slandered,&amp;quot; Advani said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Such a thing has never happened in the House of Commons... adjourned for no reason. I feel ashamed,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Rajya Sabha, similar acrimonious scenes were witnessed. It was first adjourned till noon amid chaos, minutes after it re-assembled following a four-day break on account of week-end and two holidays.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon after the house met for the day, the Chair allowed Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad to speak but members from the treasury benches did not let him speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This should also go on record that in both the houses, it is the ruling party (BJP) that is not allowing any work,&amp;quot; Azad said, adding that it was happening for the &amp;quot;first time in the history of India&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien kept on urging protesting members to maintain peace but his pleas went unheeded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Why should both sides create problem? I don't know,&amp;quot; he said and adjourned the house till noon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later, the house was adjourned for 30 minutes and then again till 2 p.m. It was finally adjourned for the day after 2 p.m. as the opposition members demanded a debate on demonetisation and plight of farmers while those on the treasury benches sought a debate on the AgustaWestland chopper deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The winter session of Parliament started on November 16 but has been washed away due to protests over the government's November 8 demonetisation and other issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bns/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Patna, Dec 15 (IANS) At an age when most children are only engaged in games and playing, this nine-year-old knows all about the planet Mars. Meet Kautilya whose prodigious knowledge, comprehension and sharp memory is the envy of even those much ahead in age and qualification.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here with his father and grandfather on Thursday to meet mathematician and Super 30 founder Anand Kumar, Kautilya left him most impressed by his knowledge, and confidence in talking as an near-equal in age. 

According to his grand father J.K. Sharma, it was his desire to take Kautilya to Anand Kumar so that he could assess the boy\'s capabilities and guide him for the future. 

\&amp;quot;What Anand has achieved, very few can match. He himself is exceptional and thus we felt that this exceptional child should get his blessings. We have come to Patna just for this purpose,\&amp;quot; Sharma said.

Kautilya also interacted with Super 30 students, who comprise carefully selected aspirants from disadvantaged sections undergoing intense training for the IIT entrance exams, and media persons.

\&amp;quot;These days, I am studying about astronomy and I want to become an astro scientist in life,\&amp;quot; said Kautilya, a class 5 student at Bhavan Vidyalaya, Panchkula (near Chandigarh), but capable of reeling out statistics, geographical locations and trivia as well as mathematical calculations as if all the information has been fed into him. 

He has all the updateS about the ongoing researches on planet Mars.

\&amp;quot;He is like that since the time he was a toddler. He was always curious with abundant questions to ask on everything he came across,\&amp;quot; said his grandfather, who approached psychologists at the Kurukshetra University to find about his immense curiosity and interests.

Kautilya\'s exceptionally high IQ level was discovered at the university where psychology professors advised his family to pay special attention to him and ensure his distinguished skills and talent are not dissipated.

\&amp;quot;It was his remarkable quality that got him on the Kaun Banega Crorepati television show on the Children\'s Day,\&amp;quot; said his father Satish Sharma, who runs a private school in the village. 

\&amp;quot;Later Bachchanji also tweeted about how much he was impressed by the wunderkid for his knowledge that defied his age,\&amp;quot; he added. 

Anand Kumar said that Kautilya was certainly different from children of his age and displayed striking knowledge and confidence. 

\&amp;quot;He needs to be carefully nurtured with a lot of freedom to do what he loves. I had also heard of him and will extend whatever help Kautilya will require,\&amp;quot; he said, adding he wished him  great success.

The hosts were on 288/3 at the close.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smith's 192-ball innings included 16 boundaries. Handscomb's 64 runs came off 150 deliveries with eight hits to the fence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Pakistan, Mohammad Amir, Wahab Riaz and Yasir Shah bagged a wicket each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Electing to bat on winning the toss, Australia were off to a good start with Matt Renshaw and David Warner producing an opening stand of 70 runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warner scored 32 runs before being trapped leg before by Amir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Usman Khawaja lasted just seven balls before stepping out to Yasir only to find Misbah-ul Haq at short midwicket.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two quick wickets may have given the Pakistanis a glimmer of hope which was quickly diminished by a 76-run partnership between Smith and Renshaw.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Riaz brought the partnership to an end when Renshaw nicked one to wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed when on 71.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Handscomb then joined Smith in the middle and the duo proceeded to add 137 runs between them to help the hosts end the opening day on a strong note.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brief scores:&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Australia: 288/3 (Steven Smith 110 batting, Peter Handscomb 64 batting, Matt Renshaw 71) vs Pakistan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Guwahati, Dec 15 (IANS) The opposition Congress in Assam has condemned the move to withdraw National Security Guards (NSG) security cover of former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi and termed it politically motivated.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sources close to Gogoi said on Thursday that the three-time Assam Chief Minister has received a letter from the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) conveying to him the decision to withdraw the NSG security cover. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is, however, no mention about the Z+ security cover, to which the former Assam Chief Minister is entitled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president and Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora condemned the central government's move and said it shows the Bharatiya Janata Party's vindictiveness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is unwarranted. This should not have happened. It is only six months that the former Chief Minister had left his office and the threat perception is still there. If something happens to him, the Ministry of Home Affairs will be responsible,&amp;quot; Bora said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leader of the Opposition in the Assam Legislative Assembly Debabrata Saikia also condemned the move and said it is a motivated move by the government to silence Gogoi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have seen that the former Chief Minister had been very vocal against the ruling government against all its wrong decisions and anti-people policies. Now the state government has taken a calculated move to silence Gogoi by withdrawing the NSG security cover,&amp;quot; Saikia said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We condemn this decision of the government,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A senior official of Assam police, however, said the police are yet to receive any instructions in this regard. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, in case the central government has decided to withdraw the NSG security cover, Gogoi will continue to get the security cover according to the Z+ category protocol,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from Gogoi, former Assam Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta is entitled to NSG security cover. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal is entitled to Z+ security cover only and his security is provided by the state police commandos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Assam police recommended NSG security cover for Sonowal, it is yet to be cleared by the Ministry of Home Affairs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ah/pgh/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Strasbourg, Dec 15 (IANS) Europe on Thursday passed a non-binding resolution calling on Germany to compensate all European victims of the drug thalidomide, which caused deformities in thousands of children in the late 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The members of the European Parliament formally requested Berlin to compensate not only German victims -- which the German government is set to do in 2017 following an amendment to the so-called &amp;quot;Thalidomide law&amp;quot; -- but also pay European victims, reports Efe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The resolution approved in a plenary session also called on the Spanish government to review its 2010 legislation and to provide a new registry of those affected by the immunomodulatory drug so they can exercise their right to compensation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the resolution is not a law and does not require Germany to take the action suggested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;German pharmaceutical Gr�nenthal first marketed the drug in 1957, in West Germany, under the trade name Contergan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was often prescribed as a sedative or hypnotic and primarily used against nausea and morning sickness in pregnant women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The drug was later sold in over 50 countries across the world under more than 80 different trade names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1961, it was discovered that thalidomide caused severe malformations to those subjected to the drug in the womb such that thousands of children were born without limbs or with underdeveloped arms and legs that were mere stumps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vgu/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Noida, Dec 15 (IANS) Income Tax officials on Thursday raided an Axis Bank branch here and froze 20 suspect accounts with deposits totalling around Rs 60 crore, police said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A police officer said the suspect accounts at the Axis Bank branch in Sector 51 in Noida were opened in the name of several fake companies and a few low income individuals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Income Tax officials found that directors/owners of these fake/shell companies are daily labourers,&amp;quot; a police officer said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The officer said these accounts came to the I-T Department's notice when a Noida jeweller sold gold worth Rs 600 crore after the November 8 demonetisation and deposited the money at the Noida bank branch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Most of the money reached the jeweller through RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement system),&amp;quot; the official said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A large number of account holders gathered outside the bank since they were not allowed inside during the daylong raid that began at around 10 a.m. Police was deployed outside the bank branch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tax officials seized several documents from the branch for scrutiny, the police officer said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, Axis Bank said in a statement that it had started rigorous compliance procedures and applied all its analytic capability to identify accounts with suspicious activity since the November 8 demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;... investigative agencies have identified some potentially suspect accounts, for which the bank has already filed STRs (Suspicious Transaction Reports) in the past with FIU-IND (Financial Intelligence Units-India). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This apart, the bank has also pro-actively filed additional STRs with FIU in this period. We understand that the visit by the investigative agencies to our branches has been pursuant to the CTRs (Current Transaction Reports) and STRs filed by the bank under the extant KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) norms as applicable to the bank,&amp;quot; the statement said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The statement said that Axis Bank had taken the &amp;quot;unprecedented step of temporarily suspending some of these accounts&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;... Axis Bank stays committed to the success of the government's demonetisation initiative and facilitating transition towards a digital economy. It is committed to maintaining the strongest operational controls and has no tolerance for undesirable behaviours that circumvent the laid out processes,&amp;quot; it said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On December 9, tax officials seized over Rs 100 crore from 44 suspect accounts from an Axis Bank branch in the Chandni Chowk area in Delhi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rak/tsb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Filmmaker Karan Johar can come to the censor board with &amp;quot;Ok Jaanu&amp;quot; -- his production on a live-in relationship -- without worrying, says Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) Chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani, who wonders why he is called corrupt if he doesn't &amp;quot;cut the kisses&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Netizens have spoken out about &amp;quot;double standards&amp;quot; being displayed by the censorship board and have raised questions on how and why the kisses in &amp;quot;Spectre&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tamasha&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ae Dil Hai Mushkil&amp;quot; were curtailed/deleted when now &amp;quot;Befikre&amp;quot; gets away with lots of kissing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gossip mills have it that money has exchanged hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Nihalani laughs it off and says, &amp;quot;So, I am corrupt if I don't cut the kisses. I am corrupt and 'sanskaari' if I cut the kisses. I might as well go with the first option.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The makers of the forthcoming &amp;quot;Ok Jaanu&amp;quot;, co-produced by Karan's Dharma Productions, are said to be now looking at a more liberal approach to their film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Nihalani is not biting the bait.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The film that you mention has not come to us as yet. And we are certainly not going to certify it keeping 'Befikre' in mind as a yardstick. Nothing like, 'Agar uske paas 20 kisses hain toh mere paas 10 ('If they have 20 kisses, we have 10'.) Every film will be certified on its individual merit,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarifying his stance on a perception being projected within the film industry that the CBFC has a soft corner for Aditya Chopra's Yash Raj Films, which has produced &amp;quot;Befikre&amp;quot;, and not such a soft corner for Karan's banner, he said: &amp;quot;You mean because we cut the kisses in 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil' and not in 'Befikre'?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Firstly, let me make it very clear that there was no kiss between Ranbir Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan to cut in 'Ae Dil Hai Mushkil'. Yes, we did cut the kiss between Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma because we felt that the kiss was unduly prolonged.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Secondly, when his film was in trouble over the presence of a Pakistani artiste, I was one of Karan's most vocal supporters. Karan is the son of my old friend, the wonderful Yash Johar who was one of the most upright and kind souls in this film industry. Karan is like my own son.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Let him come to the censors with 'Ok Jaanu', ekdum befikre. We'll do whatever is the right thing to do.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;skj/rb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Union government on Thursday said that it has no intention of printing new notes worth the entire Rs 15.44 lakh crore, that was in circulation in high denomination notes before demonetisation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The remonetisation will be as per requirement. There is no target that we have to reach (print) Rs 15 lakh crore,&amp;quot; Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told reporters here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The government has given significant push to digitisation and digital payments. So the requirement of the cash will be measured and according to that it will be pushed into circulation,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das said that by December-end, government would have put about 50 per cent of Rs 15.44 lakh crore in circulation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Roughly in another week or 10 days, or let's say by end of December, about 50 per cent of the notes will be supplied back in circulation. Roughly, more than Rs 5 lakh crore have been given to the markets already,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das also said that in the past five weeks, the Reserve Bank of India has supplied three times of the quantum of lower denomination currency in the markets before demonetisation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;On November 8, there was Rs 1.60 lakh crore of Rs 100 notes in circulation. In the last five weeks, we have supplied Rs 80,000 crore of Rs 100 notes to the market, which is three times more,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mm/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Dec 15 (IANS) Beijing is likely to see this year's worst smog in the coming days, with the authorities issuing a red alert for air pollution.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A thick blanket of smog is likely to hit the city on Friday and may last for five days, Xinhua news agency reported. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The China National Environmental Monitoring Centre said Beijing and neighbouring Tianjin municipality and Hebei province will suffer from heavy air pollution. It will also affect Shandong and Henan provinces.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was around the same time last year when Beijing issued a red alert -- the highest of the four-tier air pollution warning system. &lt;br&gt;              &lt;br&gt;A red alert is also issued if the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) reaches 500.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The red alert, which will be sounded from 8 p.m. on Friday, will ensure the suspension of construction activities while schools will be shut. Besides, half the cars will be off the roads since the odd-even number plate rule will come into place. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alert will be called off on December 21. &lt;br&gt;      &lt;br&gt;Beijing is one of the world's most polluted cities. It borders Hebei province, which accounts for 25 per cent of China's steel production. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Air pollution is one of the biggest problems in Beijing. Authorities have been shutting down polluting factories around the city. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In June this year, a report said that worsening air pollution had reduced the average life expectancy in China by over two years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It said air pollution was claiming a total 1.2 million lives every year in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gsh/mr&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Chennai, Dec 15 (IANS) Jayant Yadav is a great addition to the Indian Test team, according to captain Virat Kohli, who on Thursday went to the extent of comparing the young off-spinner to former England star Graeme Swann who had tasted considerable success in India.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Jayant knows his game very well. He knows his bowling very well and has a lot of control,&amp;quot; Kohli told reporters on the eve of India's fifth Test against England here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;He rushes the batsmen. He doesn't give batsmen time after the ball has pitched. I think Graeme Swann was very similar in the way he bowled. His control was magnificent without giving the ball too much air. That's why he was so successful here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As a captain, I know that as a third bowler, the batsman cannot independently go after him as he can take two-three wickets. He has been a great addition to Team India,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India have already won the five-match rubber 3-0. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yadav has picked up nine wickets in the three matches that he has played, also contributing heavily with the bat scoring 221 runs at an average of 73.66 which also includes a century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kohli said the Indians intend to maintain the same intensity although the result of the Chennai Test will have bearing on the series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The intensity and motivation to win a Test match remains the same. We are looking at one game at a time,&amp;quot; he asserted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lauding star off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for his batting, Kohli said, &amp;quot;Ashwin has set a benchmark for the other spinners to contribute as well. Jadeja has come of age with his batting. We saw that in Mohali where he came out and got those 90 runs for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Even the bowlers understand the importance of their contribution with the bat. So as a captain it gives you a lot of freedom to play five batsmen where your bowlers contribute 120-130 runs every game for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked about him not taking the aerial route at all nowadays in Tests and whether it is a concerted effort, Kohli, who has hit just one six in the series so far, said: &amp;quot;I don't necessarily feel the need to hit sixes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Its just an excitement on the part of a batsman at 150-160 when you feel like expressing yourself but then I realise if I score three-four runs in an over without even hitting a boundary, you don't need to take the big risk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If I and my management have decided to play five batsmen, then I have to take up more responsibility.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kohli has scored in most cricket-playing nations except for England, where he endured a tough tour two years ago. Overall, he has played five Tests in England averaging just 13.40 with his highest score being 39. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quizzed on whether he would like to play county cricket before India's tour to England, he said: &amp;quot;If I have a chance, I would love to do that. I would love to be there a month, a month-and-half before the tour, get used to playing in those conditions, understand how the wickets behave in that particular time of the year.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dm/ajb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Veteran BJP leader L.K. Advani on Thursday said he feels like resigning from Parliament because of unending disruptions in both houses.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advani, one of the country's most respected parliamentarians, also felt that the now ailing former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would have felt sad to see the situation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advani, who only last week expressed his disgust over the frequent bedlam in Parliament, said the house should function at least for a day and discuss demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi thanked Advani for fighting for democratic values while Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said the BJP leader was actually upset with opposition leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Thursday, as the Lok Sabha was adjourned, Advani remained seated even as other members left the house.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Textiles Minister Smriti Irani walked up to him and spoke to him. After a couple of minutes, she called Home Minister Rajnath Singh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the media gallery, Advani was heard telling Rajnath Singh to convey to Speaker Sumitra Mahajan that she should ensure the house runs on Friday to discuss demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few minutes later, Rajnath Singh and Irani left but Advani remained in his seat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was then joined by Idris Ali, one of the most vocal members of the Trinamool Congress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ali later told reporters that he enquired about his health, to which the former Deputy Prime Minister sighed: &amp;quot;My health is fine but the health of Parliament is not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I feel like resigning,&amp;quot; said Advani, his comments audible from the media gallery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he was talking to Ali, two more MPs, including Nana Patole of the BJP, joined the discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Idris then asked Advani about Vajpayee's health. Advani replied: &amp;quot;He would have been very sad to see this.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BJP leader said the ruling and opposition leaders should meet Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and the house should debate demonetisation at least on Friday, the last day of the winter session.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If the situation is the same on the last day as well, Parliament will be slandered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Such a thing has never happened in the House of Commons... adjourned for no reason. I feel ashamed,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ali complained to Advani that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was not being allowed to speak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advani countered: &amp;quot;Don't take any person's name. The issue is that Parliament should discuss the matter.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon after the incident, Rahul Gandhi's official Twitter handle posted a link of the report on Advani's comment, saying: &amp;quot;Thank you Advaniji for fighting for democratic values within your party.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said Advani was &amp;quot;clearly berating his own party&amp;quot; and not the Congress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Advani is an extremely senior parliamentarian and BJP is deliberately, consciously twisting these things to suggest that his angst and anguish is against the Congress. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is ridiculous.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Dec 15 (IANS) China on Thursday said its deployment of defensive facilities on some islands in the South China Sea was legitimate and normal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks in response to a question regarding a US think tank report saying China appeared to have installed weapons on seven islands in the South China Sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calling the South China Sea islands China's inherent territory, Geng said China's building of necessary defensive facilities on its own territory is completely normal and has nothing to do with militarisation, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If China's building normal facilities and deploying necessary territorial defensive facilities on its own islands is considered militarisation, then what is the sailing of fleets in the South China Sea,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Currently, the situation of the South China Sea issue is moving in a good and positive direction, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We hope countries concerned could respect the efforts of China and Asean members, and maintain the positive momentum of the South China Sea situation,&amp;quot; he added.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/ahm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) In a bid to boost digital payments, the government on Thursday launched two incentive schemes for both consumers and merchants, said Niti Ayog CEO Amitabh Kant.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For consumers, there is the Lucky Grahak Yojana that would reward consumers through a daily as well as a weekly draw on transactions worth Rs 50 to Rs 3,000, with a maximum reward up to Rs 1 lakh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana, meant for merchants, would have a maximum reward of Rs 50,000, Kant said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The schemes would commence from December 25, Christmas Day, and would conclude on April 14 - birth anniversary of Bhim Rao Ambedkar -- next year with mega awards, Kant said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Following demonetisation, there has been a spurt in the digital payments across the country and both the volume and amount of money transacted through digital methods has seen manifold increase since November 9.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our objective is to make digital payments a mass movement,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giving details of the schemes, Kant said, &amp;quot;Lucky Grahak Yojana would have daily reward of Rs 1,000 to be given to 15,000 lucky consumers for a period of 100 days. Besides, there would be weekly prizes worth Rs one lakh, Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000 for consumers who use digital mode of payments.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only consumers using UPI, USSD, AEPS and RuPay cards would be included in the draw and consumers paying through private credit cards and digital wallets would not be included for the time being, Kant said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Digi-Dhan Vyapar Yojana would have prizes for merchants for all digital transactions conducted at merchant establishments. There would be weekly prizes worth Rs 50,000, Rs 5,000 and Rs 2,500,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, there would be a mega lucky draw on April 14, 2017 where the consumers would win three mega prizes worth Rs 1 crore, Rs 50 lakh and Rs 25 lakh for digital transactions between November 8, 2016 and April 13, 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There would be three mega prizes for merchants too worth Rs 50 lakh, Rs 25 lakh and Rs 5 lakh for digital transactions between the same period, said Kant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All transactions between consumers and merchants; consumers and government agencies and all Aadhar Enabled Payments (AEPS) transactions will be considered for the incentive scheme. Business to Business (BtoB) transactions are also included.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) is the implementing agency for the scheme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The primary aim of these schemes is to incentivize digital transactions so that electronic payments are adopted by all sections of the society, especially the poor and the middle class,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The winners shall be identified through a random draw of the eligible Transaction Ids(which are generated automatically as soon as the transaction is completed) by software to be especially developed by NPCI for this purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A person can win a prize for a maximum of three times, Kant said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that the transactions would be safe as there would be two-factor authentication for each transaction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The NPCI has been directed to ensure a technical and security audit of the same to ensure that the technical integrity of the process is maintained,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The estimated expenditure on the first phase of the scheme (up to April 14, 2017) is likely to be Rs 340 crore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is time to organise the unorganised...

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec. Dec 15 (IANS) The Supreme Court indicated on Thursday that it may replace the existing office-bearers of the Indian cricket board with a three-member committee as it asked the country's cricket governing body to suggest the probable names who could be included in the committee.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bench of Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, Justice A.M. Khanwilkar and Justice D.Y. Chandrachud sought names from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) as it opposed making former Union Home Secretary G.K. Pillai the observer to head the three-member committee to oversee implementation of the organisational reforms recommended by the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The court also made it clear that it has taken a dim view of the manner in which BCCI President Anuurag Thakur had tried to mislead the court and may haul him up for perjury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The apex court said that it was a case of perjury and fit for prosecution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anurag Thakur is also a member of the Lok Sabha, elected from the Hamirpur constituency in Himachal Pradesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for the BCCI, sought to apologise on behalf of the board chief, Chief Justice Thakur said, &amp;quot;You tell us ... you asked for a letter (from International Cricket Council (ICC) President Shashank Manohar) that the presence of the nominee of the CAG on the BCCI board amounted to government interference in the cricketing body's affairs.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Sibal tried to play it down suggesting that was not what the BCCI President meant, the Chief Justice said, &amp;quot;This is exactly what you meant. That is, the nominee of the CAG is government interference. Whom are you trying to...You ought to apologise, if you want to escape. We don't know what will happen.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brushing aside the repeated explanation offered by Sibal, the court asked him: &amp;quot;There was no occasion (for Anurag Thakur to seek clarification from ICC) as this court had directed. Where was the occasion for seeking clarification?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The matter relates to Anurag Thakur asking the ICC President to clarify on his position which he had taken as the BCCI chief that the presence of the CAG nominee on the board of the apex cricketing body would amount to government interference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manohar, himself a prominent Indian lawyer, had said that the position Thakur had taken as the BCCI president was when court was hearing the matter, but now there was a judgment and the question does not arise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking exception to the conduct of Anurag Thakur, the Chief Justice said: &amp;quot;You had sought the clarification so that you can return to us and say this is what the ICC feels about court's directions.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The top court's observations came in the course of the hearing on the first and third status report submitted by the Justice Lodha Committee that had recommended superseding the existing BCCI office-bearers, appointing Pillai as observer and setting up a three-member committee comprising the former union home secretary and two other people, including from the public, to run the affairs of the BCCI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium had suggested the name of former cricketer Mohinder Amarnath as one of the members of the committee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While reserving the order on the deliberation on the recommendation by the Justice Lodha Committee, the apex court gave the BCCI a week's time to suggest the names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) India on Thursday reiterated that the Indus Waters Treaty is a bilateral issue and technical questions and differences should be resolved bilaterally.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;India has always believed that the implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty, which includes the redressal of the technical questions and differences, should be done bilaterally between India and Pakistan,&amp;quot; External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said in his weekly media briefing here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There are examples available where such matters had been successfully resolved bilaterally within the Permanent Indus Commission (such as the height of the freeboard for Kishan Ganga) or between the two governments as seen in the Salal Hydro Electric Project in 1978,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this week, the World Bank Group, which had brokered the 1960 treaty, announced a pause in the separate processes initiated by India and Pakistan to allow the two countries to consider alternative ways to resolve their disagreements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a statement issued by the World Bank, the announcement temporarily halts the appointment of a neutral expert, as requested by India, and the chairman of the Court of Arbitration as requested by Pakistan, to resolve issues regarding the two power plants under construction by India along the Indus rivers system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the September 18 cross-border terror attack on an army base at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 19 Indian soldiers, New Delhi, which blamed Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, said that it would consider revisiting the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India has control over three eastern rivers -- Beas, Ravi and Sutlej -- all flowing from Punjab and Pakistan, controls the western rivers of the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum that flow from Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jammu and Kashmir has been demanding a review of the treaty as it robs the state of its rights to use the water of the rivers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The current processes under the treaty concern the Kishenganga (330 MW) and Ratle (850 MW) hydroelectric power plants, being built by India on the Kishenganga and Chenab rivers respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Given the will to address these matters through the appropriate mechanisms provided for in the Indus Waters Treaty, there is no reason why the technical design parameters on which Pakistan has raised objections cannot be sorted out by professional, technical experts from both sides,&amp;quot; Swarup said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We had advised the World Bank not to rush for initiating two parallel processes simultaneously and hold more consultations,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is a matter of satisfaction that this point has now been recognised by the World Bank. We believe that these consultations should be given adequate time.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indus Waters Treaty was seen as one of the most successful international treaties and has withstood frequent tensions between India and Pakistan, including conflict.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ab/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Negi on December 16, 1993, to initiate steps to declare the Hattee community a Scheduled Tribe, said a state government functionary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Commission, in its 1979-80 report, too had made that recommendation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vg/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bengaluru, Dec 15 (IANS) Three days after signing midfielder Harmanjot Khabra, I-League champions Bengaluru FC bolstered their position further by adding Lenny Rodrigues on a season-long loan deal from ISL side FC Pune City, the club announced on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lanky twenty nine-year-old from Goa will look to lend his experience to Albert Roca's side having previously spent six seasons with Churchill Brothers along with loan stints with Dempo and Mohun Bagan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is a dream for me. I was in talks with Bengaluru when the club was formed in 2013 but things didn't work out due to my existing commitments. It's nice to be able to get that chance again and I want to make it count. It's an honour to turn out for a champion side like Bengaluru's,&amp;quot; Rodrigues said, according to a Bengaluru FC release.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bengaluru coach Roca said he was confident about the value addition that Lenny would bring to the squad. &amp;quot;We've been keeping an eye on Lenny and I have even been watching some old footage of him. We think he will fit well into our system and we're glad to have him on the team,&amp;quot; said Roca.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dm/sam/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 15 (IANS) Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie's public disclosure in 2013 regarding her surgery for breast cancer led to a spike in genetic tests for a gene known to increase the deadly disease, a study has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jolie lost her mother to ovarian and breast cancer and grandmother and aunt to breast cancer. In an op-ed piece in The New York Times -- a major US daily -- Jolie announced that she had undergone surgery in order to reduce her chances of getting the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;My doctors estimated that I had an 87 per cent risk of breast cancer and a 50 per cent risk of ovarian cancer...I made a decision to have a preventive double mastectomy,&amp;quot; wrote Jolie, in the article on May 14, 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the study, led by researchers from Harvard Medical School in Boston, US, the rates of genetic testing for breast cancer increased by 64 per cent in the two weeks following Jolie's testimonial. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the rates of mastectomy did not increase among women who underwent BRCA gene testing. This suggests those who received the genetic test had a low risk of carrying the mutation in the first place, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results illustrate that celebrity endorsements can fuel the use of health care services but may not effectively target the populations in greatest need of such services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our findings underscore celebrity endorsements as a powerful influence on health-related behaviours, but they also show that such endorsements do not necessarily target those most at risk for developing a disease,&amp;quot; said lead investigator Sunita Desai from Harvard Medical School in Boston, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When people request a test or an intervention based on a celebrity endorsement, it is critical that physicians provide careful assessment of a patient's medical and family history with clear explanations about the pros and cons of choosing to have the test versus foregoing testing in the context of the individual's specific circumstances, the researchers suggested, in the study published in The BMJ in December, 2016. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/vgu/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Madrid, Dec 15 (IANS) Although Atletico Madrid suffered the heartbreak of losing the last Champions League final on penalties to local rivals, Real Madrid, they started the current season in great form, playing perhaps their most entertaining football in over a decade.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the wheels have come off in the last six weeks and after suffering a shock 0-3 defeat at home against Real Madrid in mid-November, they have slipped to sixth place in La Liga, 12 points off the top of the table, when two months ago they were many people's title favourites, reports Xinhua.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Everyone is talking of a crisis, but I don't think it's a crisis,&amp;quot; Atletico's Belgian winger, Yannick Carrasco told sports paper 'Marca&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These things can happen and it's normal when the side has been at such a high level for so long, but it is a long season and we have a lot of games to get back to where we want to be,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Carrasco insisted Atletico's aim was to finish in the top-four and qualify for next season's Champions League, while pointing out that they finished ahead of Bayern Munich in this season's group stage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have great players and a very good side, as well as captains, who know how to lead us,&amp;quot; he said, adding that the team had to look only at the next game, rather than fix long-term objectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have to work hard every day in order to start winning matches again and go as far as possible in the league. We are not under any pressure to fight for the title, we have to qualify for the Champions League, but we have to take things one day at a time and play every games as if it is a final,&amp;quot; he insisted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally Carrasco discussed head coach Diego Simeone, who in September reached an agreement with the club to shorten his contract so it ends in 2018 rather than in 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I don' t see any change in him,&amp;quot;  said Carrasco. &amp;quot;Simeone is a winner and he has united the team that is fully behind him.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Actress Fatima Sana Sheikh, who is playing the character of wrestling champion gold medallist Geeta Phogat in Aamir Khan-starrer &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot;, says she now loves the sport and understands it better after she went through intense training to shoot the film.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fatima told IANS here: &amp;quot;I have always been a movie buff and had no interest in any games and sports. I do not even watch cricket, which is one of the favourite games of most of my friends. However, I have become a wrestling fan after 'Dangal'. As an audience, I watch the game sitting at the edge of the seat and scream as if I am in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I get excited while watching any wrestling match now.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actress went through eight months of training as part of her preparation to play Geeta's character in the film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working with Aamir Khan helped her to understand the craft of acting better, she said adding that it is creatively challenging to do small scenes and sequences in a film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I found it more challenging to act in a small scene, especially if it has no dialogue and if it is a close-up with only expressions. When you are doing a long scene, you have a dialogue and interaction to narrate the character. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But making sense out of facial expression and reacting is difficult. Having said that, I think such challenges are good for learning,&amp;quot; said Fatima.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked about her favourite scene of the film, Fatima said: &amp;quot;There is a scene where Babita celebrates for Geeta after she wins a match. I know as Fatima that those reactions and emotions were as genuine as it could be for Sanya (Sanya Malhotra who plays Babita in the film) because we share a strong emotional bonding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;She is not only my co-actor, but a very close friend.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting her career with the film &amp;quot;Chachi 420&amp;quot; as baby girl Bharti, Fatima has acted in various television series and has featured in small roles in films like &amp;quot;Tahaan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Bittoo Boss&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Akaash Vani&amp;quot;, among others, before getting her big break with &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot; is releasing on December 23.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;aru/rb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Chaos reigned on Thursday, the penultimate day of the winter session of Parliament, as opposition members and those on the treasury benches indulged in recrimination over the issues of demonetisation, corruption and other issues.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Lok Sabha, the opposition pressed for a debate on demonetisation while the treasury benches demanded a discussion on the AgustaWestland helicopter deal.

Both sides shouted at each other as Speaker Sumitra Mahajan warned the members against displaying newspapers in the house, before adjourning it till noon. 

The opposition accused the Bharatiya Janata Party members of obstructing the debate.

Telangana Rashtra Samiti leader A.P. Jithender Reddy said he should be allowed to speak as he had started the discussion on demonetisation under Rule 193.

\&amp;quot;Every party has a problem with the implementation of demonetisation... I was not allowed to speak,\&amp;quot; Reddy said.

Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay said: \&amp;quot;There is one more day left before the end of the session. A discussion could have been initiated, without any rules.\&amp;quot;

Parliamentary Affairs Minister H.N. Ananth Kumar raised the issue of the AgustaWestland VVIP helicopter deal and said names of certain Congress leaders are mentioned in middleman Christian Michel\'s diary.

This further irked the opposition members, leading to more ruckus, following which Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the house for the day.

Similar acrimonious scenes were witnessed in the Rajya Sabha. It was first adjourned till noon amid chaos, minutes after it reassembled following a four-day gap.

Soon after the House met for the day, the Chair allowed Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad to speak but members from the treasury benches did not allow him to speak.

\&amp;quot;This should also go on record that in both the houses, it is the ruling party (BJP) that is not allowing any work,\&amp;quot; Azad said, adding that it was happening for the \&amp;quot;first time in the history of India\&amp;quot;.

Deputy Chairman P.J. Kurien kept on urging protesting members to maintain peace but his pleas went unheeded.

\&amp;quot;Why should both sides create problem? I don\'t know,\&amp;quot; he said and adjourned the house till noon.

Later, the house was adjourned for 30 minutes and then again till 2 p.m. After 2 p.m., it was finally adjourned for the day as the opposition members demanded a debate on demonetisation and plight of farmers while those on the treasury benches wanted a debate on the AgustaWestland chopper deal.

The winter session of Parliament started on November 16 but has been washed away due to protests over the government\'s November 8 demonetisation. It will conclude on Friday, December 16.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Negative global indices, coupled with rupee depreciation and outflow of foreign funds, subdued the Indian equity markets on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two benchmark indices -- which opened in the red -- discounted the much awaited decision of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hike interest rates and brushed off their early losses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, selling pressure dragged the key indices to close the day's trade in the negative territory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The US Fed has talked of four rate hikes in 2017 and four in 2018. We need to wait and see how many times the US Fed raises rates,&amp;quot; Union Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das said here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Indian markets had already factored in the hike in interest rates by 25 bps (basis points) by the US Fed. They will stabilise after some volatility, along with the currency market,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wider 51-scrip Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) inched down by 28.85 points or 0.35 per cent at 8,153.60 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The barometer 30-scrip Sensitive Index (Sensex) of the BSE, which opened at 26,497.71 points, closed at 26,519.07 points -- down 83.77 points or 0.31 per cent from the previous close at 26,602.84 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sensex touched a high of 26,737.86 points and a low of 26,407.58 points during the intra-day trade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BSE market breadth was tilted in favour of the bears -- with 1,317 declines and 1,280 advances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, the equity markets were suppressed by upcoming global economic events' risks and weak European indices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The barometer index was down 94.98 points or 0.36 per cent, while the NSE Nifty edged down by 39.35 points or 0.48 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Markets ended lower on Thursday after a volatile session. The Nifty opened sharply lower and then witnessed an equally sharp recovery,&amp;quot; Deepak Jasani, Head of retail research, HDFC Securities, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But selling soon emerged at higher levels and brought the index back into negative territory on the back of weak Asian markets, following aggressive roadmap of interest rate hikes drawn by the US Fed yesterday.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a commentary, SMC Global Securities said: &amp;quot;As expected, US Fed hiked 25 bps in the recent meeting and the outlook on further rate hikes was hawkish and this has made the Indian market volatile amid lack of domestic as well as global cues.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There is a concern in the market regarding the possible pull out of fund by the foreign market participants. Also the upholding worries about near term economic outlook due to the impact of demonetisation continue to weigh on sentiment of the market participants.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A weakened rupee on the back of a strong US dollar and outflows of foreign funds also spooked investors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indian rupee weakened by 40 paise to 67.84 against a US dollar from its previous close of 67.44 to a greenback.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of investments, provisional data with exchanges showed that the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold stocks worth Rs 611.97 crore, whereas the domestic institutional investors (DIIs) divested scrip worth Rs 177.48 crore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Dhruv Desai, Director and Chief Operating Officer of Tradebulls, IT and most banking stocks faced resistance at higher levels in the second half of the session.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Pharma, oil-gas, textile and media-entertainment stocks traded with bearish sentiments, while FMCG, cement and power stocks traded down due to selling pressure,&amp;quot; Desai explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Firm USD/INR futures prices also pressurised the price movement of Indian equity markets.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sector-wise, the S&amp;P BSE healthcare index plunged by 210.49 points, followed by the consumer durables index by 87.66 points, and the automobile index by 64.02 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, the S&amp;P BSE banking index rose by 61.18 points, the IT index gained 58.14 points, and the Teck (technology, media and entertainment) index inched up by 13.77 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Major Sensex gainers on Thursday were: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), up 2.34 per cent at Rs 2,259.50; Axis Bank, up 2.17 per cent at Rs 477.10; ONGC, up 1.35 per cent at Rs 206.45; Power Grid, up 1.10 per cent at Rs 183.90; and Bajaj Auto, up 0.95 per cent at Rs 2,674.65.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Major Sensex losers were: Sun Pharmaceuticals, down 4.36 per cent at Rs 649.45; NTPC, down 2.02 per cent at Rs 160.30; Tata Motors, down 1.94 per cent at Rs 463.45; ITC, down 1.42 per cent at Rs 229.80; and Bharti Airtel, down 1.24 per cent at Rs 318.45.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ppg-rv/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited has floated a limited tender for the purchase of AESA (active electronically scanned array) radars for an under-development Light Combat Aircraft 'Tejas' from global aviation firms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The tender in the form of Expression of Interest (EoI) was floated on Wednesday to five of the global aviation technology firms,&amp;quot; a top HAL source said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The EoI was floated by the Aviation Research and Design Centre (ARDC), one of the 10 design centres of HAL, which is engaged in the design and development of LCA 'Tejas', source added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The source said Israel is a front-runner in the race, along with a firm from the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The India head of one of the contender companies told IANS on the condition of anonymity: &amp;quot;We have been in touch with the HAL for the last two years. We have given them an extensive presentation on the matter.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The HAL has been engaging with global manufacturers vis-a-vis the AESA radars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The imported radar will require customisation to suit the LCA's requirements and this will be done jointly by the ARDC and the vendor,&amp;quot; the source added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is not yet clear whether some of the radars will be manufactured in India or be a totally off-the-shelf purchase,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By current estimates, around 100 radars are expected to be procured through this tender.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An AESA radar detects flying objects through electronic steering of radio waves. The advanced radars are considered significantly better than mechanical scanning radars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bengaluru-based Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is developing AESA radar for Tejas Mark II. The LRDE is expected to deliver the radars to the HAL by 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government last month cleared a proposal for the purchase of 83 LCA MK1As for the Indian Air Force. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to an earlier plan, LCA Mk-II were to be fitted with AESA radars. The Mk1A, a stopgap version of the aircraft to replenish depleting fighter squadron strength of the Indian Air Force, has been cleared for fitment with imported AESA radars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indigenous Tejas received its 'Release to Service Certificate', also known as Initial Operational Clearance-II, in December 2013. The Initial Operational Clearance-1 for the fighter jet was achieved in January 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In July, the HAL delivered first two of these aircraft for IAF's Flying Daggers 45, the first LCA squadron. Subsequently, the third aircraft was delivered to the IAF. The squadron is located in Bengaluru.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The HAL is currently manufacturing eight Tejas per year and by 2018 the manufacturing capacity is expected to be doubled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rs/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Contending that it was akin to having a &amp;quot;vulgar dance along with classical dance&amp;quot;, the CPI has urged Chief Justice of India to reconsider the Supreme Court verdict mandating cinema halls play the National Anthem before the start of movies.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hailing the apex court's November 30 judgment, Communist Party of India (CPI) national secretary K. Narayana, in a letter to Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, said the implementation of the verdict will create lot of problems.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contending that the National Anthem should not be taken so lightly to be played in every show of theaters just before the film begins, he said: &amp;quot;It is just like having vulgar dance along with traditional classical dance.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In our country right now, the era of intolerance is prevailing. Many anti-social elements will also attend theatres. Multi-religious people come to theaters. Intoxicated gangsters also will attend movies. Hence probable chances are there for eruption of communal violence in various states,&amp;quot; said Narayana, noting that under the prevailing circumstances, limiting the National Anthem to government functions, and schools etc was the &amp;quot;most rational&amp;quot; step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You can reconsider the verdict given by Supreme Court. It is not out of context to mention to&lt;br&gt;remind that several judgements were being reviewed in the past, debated and were withheld and kept in abeyance,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the verdict, several people have been arrested  for failing to stand when the National Anthem was being played at theatres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;and/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The Finance Ministry on Thursday said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was now focusing on printing of Rs 500 notes which would ease the liquidity situation over the next 2-3 weeks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The situation has considerably improved. I expect in 2-3 weeks, the situation will ease out because of the focus on printing of Rs 500 notes,&amp;quot; Economic Affairs Secretary Shaktikanta Das told reporters here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das said that initially the focus was to supply enough Rs 2,000 notes so as to replenish the demonetised notes as soon as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Initial focus was to supply Rs 2,000 notes to replenish the earlier Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Parallely, printing of Rs 500 notes had started.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;More and more production lines have been diverted for Rs 500 notes as enough stock of Rs 2,000 notes is now there. Printing of Rs 500 notes significantly stepped up so that Rs 2,000 notes become more mobile,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das said that the process of distribution has also been further streamlined with printing presses being linked to distribution areas nearer to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For making adequate cash available in the rural areas, cooperative banks have been given enough money to provide for crop loans, he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government is in touch with the RBI and National Bank For Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) to ensure district cooperative banks have enough cash, he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are identifying rural areas from where we are getting reports of inadequate cash. Emphasis is also on greater cash to rural areas,&amp;quot; Das said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the ATMs not having enough cash, he said that out of 2.20 lakh ATMs, over two lakh have already been recalibrated. Many a times banks prefer to give out cash through their branches to their own customers rather than putting in the ATMs that results in no-cash in the ATMs at times, he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;More than two lakh ATMs already recalibrated. Larger number of ATMs are working. It is not correct that only 13 per cent ATMs are working. Have advised banks to focus on loading money in ATMs also,&amp;quot; Das said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The circulation will also increase as the large amount of seized notes will also be put back in circulation as soon as possible, he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the designing and security features of the new notes, Das said that the Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes have been indigenously designed which lessens the scope of counterfeiting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is the first time that the design of notes is done indigenously. Earlier Rs 500 notes were all designed outside. Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes have been entirely designed in-house. So they are much more secure. Scope of  counterfeiting is far far lower,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mm/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The massive trading sector of the economy has been brought down to its knees due to cash crunch, unable to conduct its business. The farmers of our nation are going through a trauma never seen before and that too not due to natural calamity but due to a man-made disaster of massive demonetisation,&amp;quot; said Banerjee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said even middle and larger industries have cut down on their production by at least 50 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Banerjee has been criticising RBI on the way demonetisation of high-value currency notes is being implemented. She also criticised Patel's 'silence' on the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also urged the Centre and RBI to &amp;quot;extend a helping hand to tea garden workers&amp;quot;, who she alleged were &amp;quot;dying&amp;quot; in the aftermath of demonetisation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The letter also said that the Governor was aware that the economy was getting derailed and GDP growth rates were being revised downwards every day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bdc/ssp/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Sheets on conveyor belt was also damaged.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to him, the total loss for Kamarajar Port may be around Rs 10 crore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is rough estimate and could be less also,&amp;quot; Bhaskarachar added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said a day before the cyclone all the ships that were berthed were asked to move out and no new vessel was brought in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Indian Coast Guard, the situation was tense at Chennai Port on December 12 after the ropes of port crane vessel 'F.C.Thangam' parted and drifted onto the decommissioned submarine 'Wagli'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, the ropes of submarine also broke as did the mooring ropes of 'MV Akbar', dredger 'Kaveri' and 'VH1'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Coast Guard, its vessel ICGS Varad was deployed to bring back the vessels set adrift to safety.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Coast Guard said the two teams of ICGS Varad and with additional manpower, ropes and two tugs re-berthed the adrift vessels safely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vj/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 15 (IANS) Researchers have in a breakthrough study found that brains of people genetically inclined towards Alzheimer's are likely to show abnormal immune reactions as early as about seven years before the expected onset of dementia.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These immune responses can be detected by means of a protein known as &amp;quot;TREM2&amp;quot; and found in the cerebrospinal fluid, offering physicians the possibility to trace the progression of the disease, the study said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, when the researchers measured the levels of TREM2 -- segregated by certain immune cells of the brain called microglia -- they were able to detect an increasing immune activity of the brain. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The activity of the microglia is stimulated by the dying brain cells, not by the deposits of amyloid proteins, called plaques, which also occur in Alzheimer's disease,&amp;quot; said Christian Haass, Professor at Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich, Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rise of TREM2 levels years before the expected occurrence of dementia symptoms can be monitored and thus the timing for the onset of dementia can be precisely predicted, the researchers noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;TREM2 levels could therefore be a biomarker used to track immune activity while Alzheimer's is progressing, irrespective of whether the disease is genetic or not. TREM2 may also serve as a therapeutic marker to monitor drug response,&amp;quot; explained Michael Ewers, Professor at Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the team included 127 individuals, with an average age of 40 years, who had a genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's. The vast majority showed no symptoms of dementia or had only minor cognitive impairments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study results are published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Noida, Dec 15 (IANS) Refuting reports that it has shut shop, Noida-based Ringing Bells -- the makers of the world's cheapest smartphone 'Freedom 251' (less that $4) -- on Thursday said that they were very much in the market and operating as earlier.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A report in TeleAnalysis, a leading news portal on the telecommunication and technology industry, claimed on Thursday that Ringing Bells owners have shut down the company and opened a new firm named MDM Electronics Private Limited which is registered in Kailash Colony in New Delhi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Mohit Goel who was the MD of Ringing Bells will remain in the post in the new company as well. Shashank Goel, also a part of Ringing Bells will remain here and Ashok Chaddha, the face of Ringing Bells, will be the President of MDM. Meanwhile, CEO Dharna Goel had also reportedly quit the company,&amp;quot; the TeleAnalysis report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Ringing Bells, MDM Electronics is a separate entity distinct from it. &amp;quot;At Ringing Bells we have our clear business objectives which we have shared earlier with everyone and we are sticking to it,&amp;quot; a spokesperson said in a company statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company said that the delivery of 'Freedom 251' will be made by retailers who will get the products, in turn, from the distributors and they, in turn, from the company as is the standard practice in trade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In addition, as has been underpinned and re-clarified on several occasions, the sales are only on cash on delivery basis. The company is making efforts to deliver more 'Freedom 251' in recent months,&amp;quot; the spokesperson added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After announcing that it has delivered 5,000 'Freedom 251' smartphones in July, Ringing Bells had said it would deliver 65,000 more to those who had booked the device in cash on delivery (COD) mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After that, no new numbers were shared and it appeared the initial hype had fizzled out. The company has since forayed into making TVs and other smartphones, burying the Freedom 251 dream.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the fresh statement, the company said that they have so far delivered around 70,000 devices in states such as West Bengal, Haryana, Himachal, Bihar, Uttarakhand, New Delhi, Punjab, Jammu &amp;amp; Kashmir, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarifying about the resignation of Dharna Goel, the spokesperson said that now Anmol Goel, who is one of the founder directors, was looking after the affairs of the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Chennai, Dec 15 (IANS) Unbeaten in 17 cricket Tests -- and with the series already sealed 3-0, India will look to registering a new record unbeaten streak when they meet England in the fifth and final Test starting here on Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the added motivation of notching up the biggest Test series triumph against England, Virat Kohli's men will take the field at a venue devastated by Cyclone Vardah earlier in the week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The local organisers are leaving no stone unturned to get things right -- from the seating arrangements to rolling burning coal plates to dry up the pitch -- before the match begins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the after-effects of the cyclone, both the teams have only Thursday to train before the match and that could be a worry for the cricketers of either side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the Indian team will be more relaxed coming into the match. India are on a 17-match unbeaten streak which equals their record of 17 Tests without a defeat between September 1985 and March 1987.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leading the series 3-0, they will be out to record their biggest Test series win over the Englishmen -- the 1992-93 series gave the Indians a 3-0 win.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They will be keen to keep the intensity and momentum going in their favour. Each player has contributed significantly to help the team earn the series-win. Led admirably by Kohli, the team has vanquished an opposition that tormented them in the past three bilateral series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 28-year-old himself has been in blazing form, having amassed 640 runs in four matches -- second highest by an Indian in a bilateral series. Former captain Sunil Gavaskar still holds the record having scored 774 runs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from Kohli, No.3 batsman Cheteshwar Pujara has come out with some telling contributions of 385 runs and, along with opener Murali Vijay (328 runs), has provided a lot of stability at the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel has scored two crucial knocks of 42 and 67 so far in two matches that the Gujarat stumper was part of and with the support of tail-enders Ravichandran Ashwin (239 runs), Ravindra Jadeja (173 runs) and Jayant Yadav (221 runs), India have always piled huge totals against England.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashwin and Jadeja have starred with the ball, picking up 27 and 16 scalps, respectively, thereby becoming India's key men in delivering the wins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashwin, now at his home in Chennai's M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, will look to continue his tormenting acts against the Englishmen. The spin trio of Ashwin, Jadeja and Jayant are expected to be again unleashed against England, who have a lot of batsmen who are low on confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The visitors will rely on captain Alastair Cook and Joe Root to show them the way, again. Cook and Root have 310 and 397 runs each, respectively, but they have lacked support from the others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the bowling department, England have a big casualty in the form of James Anderson, who has been ruled out of the fifth Test due to stiffness, captain Cook said on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anderson has struggled in the series with only four wickets from two matches after coming back from an injury to his left shoulder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, England are pleased with the fitness of fellow pacer Stuart Broad, who has been struggling with a foot injury.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leg-spinner Adil Rashid has been the outstanding bowler for England, taking 22 wickets -- but with no support from the other end, he has proved to be costly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;pur/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Middlesbrough (England), Dec 15 (IANS) English football club Liverpool's coach Juergen Klopp on Thursday said he is happy with the kind of goalkeepers at his disposal after Loris Karius drew flak for his shaky displays under the bar recently.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liverpool blanked Middlesbrough 3-0 after Adam Lallana's header opened the scoring in the first half on Tuesday, followed by strikes from Divock Origi and a second for Lallana. But it was Karius' unimpressive display that was the highlight of the match and became the talking point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The situation is LFC is a long-term project. We really want to improve the club. We know we have to be successful as soon as possible, but on the other hand we all feel comfortable in the situation with each other - the goalkeepers included,&amp;quot; Klopp told Liverpool's official website on Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I know how strong Loris Karius is, but unfortunately he couldn't show it in the last one, two, three games - I'm not sure, that's not too important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am absolutely not interested in public pressure, but I am interested in the boy and there is no reason to push him through this situation. I am really happy with our goalkeeper situation,&amp;quot; Klopp said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klopp refused to name Lallana as the best English player going by current form, saying instead that it's his side that's the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In my opinion, we have the best English players - all of them. I am fine with them, but I am not long enough here and didn't see too much about the other teams. It's not too simple in England to watch football.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But all good, we are happy when he is fit and can perform like this,&amp;quot; he concluded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dm/sam/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

I feel the word 'outsider' shouldn't even exist in the Indian dictionary. I am a citizen of India, I was born here, I pay my tax here so then how am I an outsider,&amp;quot; Richa told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's so sad that we have to use this term for people who are not born to a film family. It's a term very commonly used by everyone because it exists and that's a sad state of affair. Even though we are Indians, we are an outsider. Why is it so,&amp;quot; she wondered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richa feels it is not easy for actors to get access in Bollywood if they don't have any filmy background.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's very difficult, it's extremely difficult... Apart from Shah Rukh Khan and Akshay Kumar who have made it big, how many people are not from the (film) business? That's why I have great respect for people like Ranveer Singh, Irrfan and whosoever has made it on their own.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the career front, Richa will next be seen in &amp;quot;Fukrey 2&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;uma/sas/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Moscow, Dec 15 (IANS) The Russian Bobsleigh Federation (RBF) intends to take up with the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) the issue of compensation for relocating the 2017 World Championship from Sochi, RBF President Alexander Zubkov has said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IBSF on Tuesday announced its decision to relocate the 2017 World Championship from the Russian city of Sochi to another venue, which would be determined by the end of the week, reports TASS.

The decision was made in light of numerous allegations on doping abuse and manipulations in Russian sports, mentioned in the recent report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).

\&amp;quot;The preparations for the World Championship were underway in line with the schedule and the boycott of a single country could not have possibly brought such drastic changes,\&amp;quot; Zubkov said on Wednesday.

\&amp;quot;However, when one refusal followed the other and so on, the international federation had to convene its executive committee for a session and it made the decision to relocate the championship.\&amp;quot;

\&amp;quot;As for the possible compensation for our preparations for the world championship, we are currently reviewing our agreement with the IBSF and will be then discussing this issue,\&amp;quot; Zubkov added.

The 2017 IBSF World Championship was scheduled to be held at the Sochi Olympic facilities between February 13 and 26.

Zubkov also said Russia won\'t boycot the competition when it will be held in a yet-to-be disclosed venue.

According to a report, delivered last Friday in London by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Independent Commission and its chairman, Canadian sports law professor Richard McLaren, over 1,000 Russian athletes competing in summer, winter and Paralympic sports could have been involved in the manipulations system to conceal positive doping tests.

McLaren\'s report claimed in particular that doping samples of 12 Russian medallists of 2014 Winter Games in Sochi had been tampered with. In addition, doping tests of two more Russian athletes, who won four gold medals at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, had been falsified as well.

The report did not mention particular names and McLaren later said the decision against making public the names of athletes, who are allegedly guilty of doping abuse, was made in respect to their private life, and, moreover, it should be done by international sports federations and not him personally.

Following the report, the Latvian and South Korean national bobsleigh and skeleton teams announced their decision to boycott the championship in Sochi.

A number of American and British athletes expressed similar intentions, while the German Olympic Committee on Tuesday proposed to relocate the tournament and offered their facilities as the venue for the championship.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) In yet another clarification on the government's demonetisation drive aimed to curb black money, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said on Thursday that the move towards a cashless economy is actually a &amp;quot;less cash economy&amp;quot; as no economy can be fully cashless.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making his opening remarks at the fifth meeting of the Parliamentary Consultative &lt;br&gt;Committee, he said digital transactions are a parallel mechanism and not a substitute for cash transactions as no economy can be fully cashless, a Finance Ministry release here said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He emphasised that a &amp;quot;cashless economy is actually a less cash economy&amp;quot;, it said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;He said that less cash can be gradually substituted to the possible extent through digital payments and transactions,&amp;quot; the statement added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the ministry, Jaitley told the committee members that the &amp;quot;government was trying its best to minimise common man's pain&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Admitting that there are visible and hidden costs in reducing cash volume in the economy, the government last week announced a series of eleven measures designed to increase the pace of digital payments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among the measures, payment by card for petrol and diesel will enjoy a discount of 0.75 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Customers will get a higher discount on digital payment as all central undertakings will ensure that the transaction fee and merchant discount rate (MDR) charges are waived on such payments, Jaitley said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suburban railway monthly and season tickets bought through digital payment will get a 0.5 per cent discount, effective from January 1, 2017, beginning with the Mumbai suburban railway network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaitley also announced that online payment for public sector insurance companies (life insurance and general insurance) will get 10 per cent discount for general insurance and 8 per cent discount for life insurance for new policies sold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bc/vd &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 15 (IANS) China has installed weapon systems on all seven artificial islands it has built in the South China Sea, a US think tank has claimed, despite Beijing promising not to militarise the region.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Images released by the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, part of the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, show anti-aircraft guns and other weapon systems that would guard against cruise missiles sitting in hexagonal structures on the islands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings came despite a pledge by the Chinese President Xi Jinping that Beijing would not militarise the 1.35 million-square-mile waters, the Telegraph reported on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China has been rapidly transforming partially submerged reefs in the Spratly archipelago into islands capable of supporting military hardware and receiving warplanes, said the US think tank. The images show new constructions on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs on the Spratly islands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It now seems that these structures are an evolution of point-defence fortifications already constructed at China's smaller facilities on Gaven, Hughes, Johnson, and Cuarteron reefs,&amp;quot; the US think tank said, citing images taken in November.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These gun and probable close-in weapon system emplacements show that Beijing is serious about defence of its artificial islands in case of an armed contingency in the South China Sea,&amp;quot; it further said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Bitzinger, a military expert in Singapore, told the Telegraph: &amp;quot;Of course, it shows that China has gone back on its 'promises' not to militarise the islands, or, indeed, the South China Sea.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China had always intended to transform the islands into military bases, or &amp;quot;unsinkable aircraft carriers&amp;quot;, Professor Bitzinger added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;China doesn't have the right to build such islands and declare them sovereign territory in the first place,&amp;quot; he said, but Beijing was &amp;quot;preparing not to be unprepared&amp;quot; for a possible conflict in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/ahm/sac&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Asserting that the Indian economy is &amp;quot;very stable&amp;quot; at the macro level, Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian on Thursday said managing demonetisation was a short-term challenge for the next few weeks and months.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;One of the challenges for the Indian economy in the short-term is to manage the demonetisation fall-out. How do we manage demonetisation in the next few weeks and months,&amp;quot; Subramanian said at an Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) interactive session here.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, this would be a short-term phenomenon,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the demand for lower Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates, Subramanian said lower and simpler taxes are always preferable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also called for inclusion of real estate and electricity into the GST value chain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Referring to some important global developments like the hike in the US Federal Reserve rates, he said the Indian economy was well-cushioned to cope with these events. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This was anticipated and expected. My own view is that the Indian economy is very well-cushioned to absorb the impact of this. The RBI policy also took account of this in a very sensible way. There may be some short-term things. This is not something we need to worry about,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the outflows from the emerging markets, he said that after the US elections, there were big fund flows from the emerging markets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But given that India is in bright spot, the impact on us would be much less,&amp;quot; Subramanian said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mm/ahm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The decision was made in light of numerous allegations of doping abuse and manipulations in Russian sport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It was not easy in Rio de Janeiro, but the team performed brilliantly,&amp;quot; Mutko, who oversees the issues regarding sports, tourism and youth policies in the country, said. &amp;quot;We have shown that sporting high achievements in Russia are at a very high level.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The year of 2016 was not easy and the reputation of the Russian sport suffered a significant blow. I am sure that we all together can overcome this challenge and return to the sports family.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are able to establish a strong anti-doping system,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I am sure we can manage it as well as our athletes. The strength of the Russian sport is in our athletes, coaches and people, who are creating all the conditions for them.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beginning this year Russian athletes were constantly in focus for numerous doping abuse accusations. WADA's Independent Commission, chaired by Canadian sports law professor Richard McLaren, conducted an investigation into doping allegations in Russian sports and eventually came up with a two-part report, the first delivered in July and the second on December 9.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sam/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 15 (IANS) People who have protein in their urine -- a marker of kidney problems -- could also be at higher risk of developing problems with thinking and memory skills or even dementia, a study has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Kidney dysfunction has been considered a possible risk factor for cognitive impairment or dementia,&amp;quot; said Kay Deckers from Maastricht University in the Netherlands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The analysis showed that people with protein -- also known as called albuminuria or proteinuria -- in the urine were 35 per cent more likely to develop cognitive impairment or dementia than people who did not have protein in their urine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Protein in the urine was associated with a modestly increased risk of cognitive impairment or dementia,&amp;quot; Deckers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Chronic kidney disease and dementia share many risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol, and both show similar effects on the brain, so they may have shared vascular factors or there may even be a direct effect on the brain from kidney problems,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to analysis on albuminuria or proteinuria, the team also observed other markers of kidney function, known as glomerular filtration rate -- best test to measure your level of kidney function and determine stage of kidney disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results were found to be mixed and did not show an association with cognitive impairment or dementia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, published online in the journal Neurology, the team conducted a meta-analysis of 22 studies on the topic, including 27,805 people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/vgu/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Anil Ambani-led Reliance Entertainment will release British filmmaker of Sikh origin Gurinder Chadhas &amp;quot;Viceroy's House&amp;quot; -- a true story of the final months of British rule in India -- in India and globally on March 3, 2017.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indian and Pakistani cast of the project is led by Manish Dayal, Huma Qureshi and Om Puri. The roles of the principal political leaders are played by Tanveer Ghani (Jawaharlal Nehru), Denzil Smith (Muhammad Ali Jinnah) and Neeraj Kabi (Mahatma Gandhi).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The British cast is led by Hugh Bonneville as Lord Mountbatten, Gillian Anderson as his wife Lady Mountbatten, Lily Travers as their daughter Pamela, and Michael Gambon and Simon Callow as key civil servants. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It is a story that is deeply personal to Gurinder, whose own family was caught up in the tragic events that unfolded as the British Raj came to an end, said a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A brief of the film reads: &amp;quot;For six months in 1947, Lord Mountbatten assumed the post of the last Viceroy, charged with handing India back to its people. Mountbatten lived upstairs together with his wife and daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Downstairs lived their 500 Hindu, Muslim and Sikh servants. As the political elite - Nehru, Jinnah and Gandhi - converged on the House to wrangle over the birth of independent India, conflict erupted. A decision was taken to divide the country and create a new Muslim homeland: Pakistan. It was a decision whose consequences reverberate to this day.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film examines these events through the prism of a marriage -- that of Dickie and Edwina Mountbatten -- and a romance -- that between a young Hindu servant, Jeet, and his intended Muslim bride, Aalia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the makers of the film, &amp;quot;Viceroy's House&amp;quot; has an inspirational message that celebrates tolerance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Many of the events depicted are either unknown or forgotten, but all have strong contemporary relevance in terms of lessons to be learnt concerning the politics of division and fear, the origins of religious extremism, and our moral responsibility towards migrants fleeing violence for a better life,&amp;quot; read the statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Produced by Deepak Nayar, Paul Mayeda Berges and Gurinder, the project is executive produced by Path�'s Cameron McCracken, Reliance Entertainment's Shibasish Sarkar, BBC Films' Christine Langan, BFI's Natascha Wharton and Ingenious Media's Tim O'Shea.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film is a Path�, Reliance Entertainment, BBC Films, Ingenious and BFI presentation of a Bend It Films/Deepak Nayar Production in association with FilmVast and Filmgate Films.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 15 (IANS) Imagine grasping a mug of coffee sitting on a chair and a robotic hand brings it in front of you, thereby reducing your efforts of getting up and getting it yourself. With new technology, such seemingly impossible feats should no longer be restricted to the realms of fantasy, research has shown.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a study that demonstrates the potential to help millions of people with disabilities, researchers at the University of Minnesota in the US have shown that it is actually possible to control a robotic hand with only your mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is the first time in the world that people can operate a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in a complex 3D environment using only their thoughts without a brain implant,&amp;quot; said lead researcher of the study Bin He, Professor at the university's Department of Biomedical Engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Just by imagining moving their arms, they were able to move the robotic arm,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, published online in the journal Scientific Reports, has the potential to help millions of people who are paralysed or have neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The non-invasive technique, called electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interface, records weak electrical activity of the participant's brain through a specialised, high-tech EEG cap fitted with 64 electrodes and converts the &amp;quot;thoughts&amp;quot; into action by advanced signal processing and machine learning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eight healthy human participants completed the experimental sessions of the study wearing the EEG cap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants gradually learned to imagine moving their own arms without actually moving them to control a robotic arm in 3D space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They started from learning to control a virtual cursor on the computer screen and then learned to control a robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in fixed locations on a table. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually, they were able to move the robotic arm to reach and grasp objects in random locations on a table and move objects from the table to a three-layer shelf by only thinking about these movements, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers said the brain-computer interface technology works due to the geography of the motor cortex - the area of the cerebrum that governs movement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When humans move, or think about a movement, neurons in the motor cortex produce tiny electric currents. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinking about a different movement activates a new assortment of neurons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sorting out these assortments using advanced signal processing laid the groundwork for the brain-computer interface used by the researchers, he pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Imphal, Dec 15 (IANS) Three Manipur Police personnel were killed and nine seriously injured in two separate ambushes on Thursday, suspected to have been carried out by militants, authorities said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No militant group claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hospital sources said the death toll may go up as the condition of some of the wounded was life threatening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The attacks came as policemen from Moreh and Thoubal police stations were being deployed in the newly created district of Tengoupal, which Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh was scheduled to inaugurate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Militants ambushed a vehicle bringing personnel from Moreh at Lokchao along the border with Myanmar at 6.30 a.m., killing Head Constable Ayub Khan and L. Maring and injuring some others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second ambush took place at Bongyang on a police team proceeding from Thoubal, killing Jiban on the spot. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The injured policemen were rushed to hospitals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Condemning the killings, Ibobi Singh conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families and announced a solatium of Rs 5 lakh each as &amp;quot;immediate relief&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He vowed to &amp;quot;give a befitting reply to the perpetrators&amp;quot;.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Monday night, trucks bringing consumer items from Assam to blockade-hit Manipur were ambushed along NH 37 injuring two drivers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;il/vd/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Jerusalem, Dec 15 (IANS) More than 1.7 million people -- some 21.7 per cent of the population -- are living in poverty in Israel today, according to the annual poverty report released by the National Insurance Institute on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the report, which is based on data gathered by the Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2015 there were 1,712,900 people, including 460,800 families and 764,200 children living below poverty line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report, published by online JPost, found that the overall poverty rate decreased from 22 per cent in 2014 while the number of families living in poverty increased from 18.8 per cent in 2014 to 19.1 per cent in 2015. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Poverty among children decreased from 31 per cent in 2014 to 30 per cent in 2015 and poverty among the elderly decreased from 22.3 per cent in 2014 to 21.7 per cent in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In defining poverty, the findings indicated that an individual with a monthly income of less than NIS 3,158 ($821) and couples earning less than NIS 5,053 ($1,314) per month were considered to be living below the poverty line; whereas a family of five individuals must earn more than NIS 9,475 ($2,465)to be considered above the poverty line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the report, the standard of living in terms of disposable median income per capita rose in real terms by 3.3 per cent in 2015, as did the poverty line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the report's author, Daniel Gottlieb, Deputy Director-General for Research and Planning at the NII, this was most likely due to the reinstatement of child allotments in 2015. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The data also broke down the poverty rates between different population groups in Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Among ultra-Orthodox families, the poverty rate decreased from 54.3 per cent in 2014 to 48.7 per cent in 2015, accounting for 17 per cent of poor families in Israel.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason for the decrease, the report notes, is primarily due to the increase in income due to employment and the reinstatement of child allotments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Arab population, the poverty rate of Arab families increased to 53.3 per cent in 2015 from 52.6 per cent in 2014, while the poverty rate among children also increased from 63.5 per cent in 2014 to 65.6 per cent in 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When compared to other OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, Israel still has the highest poverty rates of all developed countries, the report noted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, the GINI index of inequality showed slight improvement, however, the country continues to remain among those with the highest measure of inequality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ahm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 15 (IANS) The US Federal Reserve hiking its key interest rate by 25 basis points could set off capital outflows from emerging market economies like India with large external funding needs and macro-economic imbalances, thereby increasing their vulnerability, Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While the impact of the rate increase on the US economy will be negligible, emerging market economies with large external funding needs and macro-economic imbalances could be vulnerable to capital outflows,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve on Wednesday increased its key interest rate by 25 basis points in the first rate hike in 2016 and just the second in a decade. The first was in December 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It raised rates by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 0.50 per cent and 0.75 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While emerging market economies could benefit from a strengthening US growth if it stimulates demand for exports, they could also suffer if higher US rates lead to a more sustained re-pricing of financial assets and tighter global financial conditions,&amp;quot; the credit rating agency said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The most direct impact will be felt in those economies that have high external financing needs relative to their foreign exchange earnings and reserves,&amp;quot; it added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The American agency said the spillover effect of the rate hike may manifest itself in different ways. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For instance, in some cases a pronounced currency depreciation could lead to higher inflation, which, along with the threat of sustained capital outflows, could force central banks to raise interest rates,&amp;quot; the report said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The (US) Fed's tightening could have negative spillovers for those with large external funding needs, high leverage, macroeconomic imbalances, or uncertainties around politics and policies,&amp;quot; it added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Federal Reserve slashed rates to zero in 2008 in the wake the financial crisis and kept it at that level throughout the period of major economic slowdown that followed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this connection, when previous Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan took charge at the RBI in 2013, at a time the US Federal Reserve had declared its intent to wind down its stimulus programme, the rupee plunged in value in respect of the US dollar on fears about a spiralling current account deficit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a series of measures, Rajan managed to stabilize the currency that also brought back investors. Giving Rajan its Central Banker of the Year award for 2015, British magazine Central Banking said in this regard that &amp;quot;Rajan's disciplined and focussed approach in leading the Reserve Bank during his first year as governor was remarkably impressive.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India is currently seen as being better equipped than other emerging markets to ride the impact of higher US interest rates because of its stronger economic growth and impressive foreign exchange reserves of more than $300 billion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian said in New Delhi on Thursday that the hike in US interest rates &amp;quot;was anticipated and expected&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Given that India is in a bright spot, the impact on us would be much smaller&amp;quot;, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bc/vgu/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

It is about two wedding planners who are set in Delhi. The first season will have 10 episodes and if it does well we will be making the second season.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The show is reportedly titled &amp;quot;Made in Heaven&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from them, directors like Vikas Bahl, Vikramaditya Motwane, Farhan Akhtar, Ram Madhvani, D K Krishna and Raj Nidimoru, Sujoy Ghosh and Asif Kapadia will be making unique shows for the Amazon Prime Video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asked whether filmmakers are keen to concentrate more on making shows than films, Zoya said: &amp;quot;I don't think that. This is a different and long format. So for a filmmaker and writer who are used to tell the story in two hours, this is an opportunity for us to tell a story in a long format. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;At the end of the day it's filmmaking and writing. It's just a different format and that's why we are happy to experiment with it.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reema said: &amp;quot;I love watching shows as much as I love watching films. There is an advantage for us in making long format shows.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; -- IANS&lt;br&gt; iv/sas/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 15 (IANS) Creating a mistaken impression by telling the truth is not only possible, it has a name - paltering. But the results of being found out can be just as harsh as intentional lying, warns a study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Rather than misstating facts or failing to provide information, paltering involves actively making truthful statements to create a mistaken impression,&amp;quot; said lead study author Todd Rogers of Harvard University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Paltering is used by politicians commonly, according to Rogers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One famous example Rogers cited was when former US President Bill Clinton said &amp;quot;there is not a sexual relationship&amp;quot; between him and former White House intern Monica Lewinski. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Starr commission later discovered that there had been a sexual relationship but it had ended months before Clinton made that statement -- thus, it was technically true but clearly misleading.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;To date, research has primarily focused on two types of deception: Lying by commission -- the active use of false statements -- and lying by omission -- the passive act of misleading by failing to disclose relevant information,&amp;quot; Rogers said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In this study, we make a novel contribution to the deception literature by identifying a third, and common, form of deception,&amp;quot; Rogers noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers conducted two pilot studies and six experiments involving over 1,750 participants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first pilot study confirmed that people in general could distinguish paltering as a distinct form of deception, different from lying by commission or omission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second pilot study, the researchers determined that it is a common form of deception, with over 50 per cent of business executives enrolled in an advanced negotiation course at Harvard Business School admitting they had paltered in some or most of their negotiations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the experiments, the researchers discovered that people preferred paltering to lying by commission, but the results of being found out can be just as harsh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While palterers tended to think of their actions as more ethical because they essentially told the truth, when the deception was revealed, they were graded as harshly by their counterparts as if they had lied by commission, said the study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When individuals discover that a prospective negotiation partner has paltered to them in the past, they are less likely to trust that partner and, therefore, less likely to negotiate with that person again,&amp;quot; Rogers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Critically acclaimed actor Atul Kulkarni, who features in one of the short films which are part of the anthology movie &amp;quot;Shor Se Shuruaat&amp;quot;, says he was interested to explore the format which offers limited screen space and time.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atul, who features in &amp;quot;Azad&amp;quot; -- one of the seven indie projects that make up HumaraMovie banner's &amp;quot;Shor Se Shuruaat&amp;quot;, said in a statement: &amp;quot;I had never worked in a short format, so I was pretty excited to try this form of storytelling.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As far as the subject of the film is concerned, it's extremely relevant. The movie deals with freedom of speech, and its inconveniences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As far as my role is concerned, in a short film, how and what you conceive is different from a feature film. You are supposed to convey the entire story in 20 to 25 minutes since there's only so much screen space and time. It doesn't have the luxury of many scenes and that kind of operation.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On his role as Azad, he said: &amp;quot;The character is pretty simple. I play a part time journalist, who speaks his mind.  There's a parallel story line that depicts his estranged relationship with his son, so there are two very interesting tracks within the short.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All projects in the anthology are based on a common theme of 'shor' (noise). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vinay Mishra, co-founder of HumaraMovie, said: &amp;quot;Shorts are a great way for big names to try something new and to experiment. Unfortunately, we don't see much of that from the big names. It would be great if they used their stature to push the envelope rather than use shorts to do more of the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Their involvement, be it Sanjay Mishra, Atul Kulkarni, Sakshi Tanwar as actors, or Mira Nair, Shyam Benegal, Imtiaz Ali as mentors, or Gulzar sahab or Rekha Bhardwaj singing, has definitely given a much-needed impetus to a project like 'Shor Se Shuruaat. When big names like this are passionate about doing something new, then it gives a tremendous boost to the medium and the people around.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The pass obviously is fantastic, the movement is great, the shot is good, but for me I probably prefer what Zlatan did after the goal because that was phenomenal,&amp;quot; Mourinho told the club's official website after the match on Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;He played in front of the back four, winning every ball in the air, controlling on the chest, cooling down the play, he is phenomenal. It is not just the goals that he scores, it is not just the goal that gives us three points, it is the leadership, the desire, the passion. Fantastic!&amp;quot; the Portuguese waxed eloquent about his two pre-season  signings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Defender Eric Bailly picked up a knock within the first seven minutes but continued to play for the first half. The second half was hard for the Ivorian as he had to be taken off soon after the restart with Matteo Darmian replacing him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We don't know (how serious it is). It is the left knee. Of course he has a problem with another dimension but showed amazing character to try and try, and try until his limit,&amp;quot; Mourinho said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;United are sixth in the points table with 27 points after 16 matches, in a list headed by Chelsea (40).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the title race and whether United were catching up, Mourinho said, &amp;quot;We are doing enough for that. If we had the points we lost at home in the draws in matches that we did more than enough to win then we would be close to the top of the league, but we lost these points and at this moment we are just closing the gap to the top four positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;There are three more matches before the end of the year and let's see how it looks on 31 December,&amp;quot; Mourinho added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dm/sam/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 15 (IANS) The world may still be divided over Brexit in terms of its implementation and consequences, but the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has given it an official nod with 1,500 other new words.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;OED editors steered clear of political controversy by defining the process of Brexit rather than its consequences or implementation, as they added the word to the dictionary this week, the Guardian reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The definition reads: &amp;quot;The (proposed) withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, and the political process associated with it. Sometimes used specifically with reference to the referendum held in the UK on 23 June 2016, in which a majority of voters favoured withdrawal from the EU.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fiona McPherson, senior editor on the OED, told the Guardian that the word has been &amp;quot;one of the fastest&amp;quot; to move from coinage to definition and listing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The influence of social media is clearly visible in many of the new coinages this time. &amp;quot;YouTuber&amp;quot;, defined as &amp;quot;frequent user of the video-sharing website YouTube, especially someone who produces and appears in videos on the site&amp;quot; has found a place in the OED for the first time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who stand up to internet trolls can now call themselves an &amp;quot;upstander&amp;quot;, defined as &amp;quot;a person who speaks or acts in support of a cause, especially one who intervenes on behalf a person being attacked or bullied&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though many additions to the 829,000 words in the dictionary arise from young people and social media, some also reflect the ageing population. Leading the way for Baby Boomers is &amp;quot;glam-ma: a glamorous grandmother, especially one who is comparatively young or fashion-conscious.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ss/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Star wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt has lashed out at the Jammu and Kashmir government for its decision to give compensation to slain terrorist Burhan Wani's family for the death of his brother Khalid in a shootout.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Khalid was allegedly killed by the security forces while attempting to visit his brother in the forests of Tral area of the Kashmir Valley on April 13, 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The PDP-BJP coalition government in Jammu and Kashmir has announced a compensation of Rs.4 lakh to Khalid's family. Khalid is one of 106 people killed either by security forces or terrorists whose families will be paid compensation by the state government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The morale of the Army and people is affected by such news. It is a matter of great regret that on the one hand Army personnel are sacrificing their lives for the country while on the other hand terrorists are getting compensation,&amp;quot; Yogeshwar tweeted in Hindi on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The London Olympics bronze medallist has a strong opinion on various national issues and has used social media to vent his feeling on several earlier occasions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Burhan, a popular terrorist leader in the Kashmir Valley belonging to the Pakistan-backed Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit, was gunned down earlier this year by the security forces.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 15 (IANS) The Trinamool Congress ministers and state legislators on Thursday held a sit-in for the second consecutive day in front of the Reserve Bank of India's regional office in Kolkata, protesting insufficient supply of new currency notes in the state, while RBI Governor Urjit Patel was attending the apex bank's board meeting inside the building.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several Trinamool supporters alongwith the party heavyweights shouted slogans and waved black flags at the gate of the Reserve Bank, demanding a roll back of the central government's demonetisation of high-value currency notes that has created an unprecedented cash crisis in the nation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Prime Minister should explain why the demonetisation was done. If it was for the benefit of common man, then why so many people are still queuing up in front of RBI office even after 37 days of the decision,&amp;quot; questioned state Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's strange that what the (RBI) Governor should decide, is being decided by the Prime Minister. Total seven countries tried the demonetisation drive in history and all have failed miserably. What made them think it would be successful in a vast country like India,&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The RBI Governor owes an explanation to the common people for snatching away their democratic rights. We demand an immediate roll-back of this decision,&amp;quot; party spokesperson Nirmal Ghosh said, referring to Patel's visit to the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bdc-mgr/ssp/ahm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The veteran goalkeeper, an India regular with 64 caps, is a big name among the home-based players. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DSK coach Dave Rogers expressed happiness to sign the footballers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said, &amp;quot;I have followed Halicharan's progress over the last two years. His development in the Indian national team, and his performances at the top level have been excellent. He is one of India's brightest young talents and his pace and quality from wide areas adds another dimension to our game and a threat to opposition teams.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Nirmal is a model professional with excellent experience; and a desire and passion which he carries both on and off the pitch. He will lead by example and bring organization along with commitment and dedication which is one of the main recruitment strategies we have at this club,&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Subrata Paul for me is the best goalkeeper in India; so to sign him for DSK Shivajians is a real coup for our club,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sam/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

With regards to building this installation for Kochi, we faced some challenges trying to complete the piece on time,&amp;quot; Mazumdar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The workers stopped coming as they were not willing to accept cheques, the cash-flow was completely choked and it was impossible to get to a bank,&amp;quot; he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, thanks to the great support from friends and patrons we were able to borrow the cash as we needed larger volumes than was permitted to withdraw from the banks or ATMs,&amp;quot; Mazumdar told IANS from Kochi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was grateful for the amazing support as the &amp;quot;installation was completed and packed in time to be transported to Kochi&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mazumdar, who considers himself an &amp;quot;expressionist painter&amp;quot;, said his installation would depict the elemental force of water as it appears in the human psyche and the surrounding environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The silver lining, according to Mazumdar, was the &amp;quot;generosity and collaborative nature of the art scene in India, as we see people come together despite the challenges&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/in/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Thiruvananthapuram, Dec 15 (IANS) Around 300 liquor outlets in Kerala will down shutters from the new fiscal in line with the Supreme Court's ruling banning the sale of liquor along highways.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A bench, headed by Supreme Court Chief Justice T.S. Thakur, on Thursday said all vendors holding licences for selling liquor would continue to do so till their licences were valid or till March 31, 2017, whichever was earlier, following which the licences would not be renewed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The order came on a batch of petitions including those by the states and NGOs. The apex court's ruling bans liquor sale within 500 metres on either side of national and state highways across the country&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kerala Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan told reporters here that he is yet to get a copy of the ruling and the decision would be adhered to by the state government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Once we get a copy of the judgement, we will study it ... at the moment, there is no decision as yet, whether to go in for appeal. First, let us get the judgement,&amp;quot; said Ramakrishnan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Kerala, liquor is presently served in around 30 five-star hotels and around 600 beer and wine parlours besides 334 state-owned retail outlets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the beer and wine parlour owners, this new decision could spell the end of their business as it cannot be moved from the present location but the state-owned retail outlets could possibly move away from the highways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's not an easy task as the new retail outlets will have to ensure that other restrictions do not affect their opening at a new location, as laws are stringent. Besides the laws, there could be possible agitations by the local populace,&amp;quot; said an industry source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biju Ramesh, who owns beer parlours in Thiruvananthapuram, said he welcomes the decision even though he would have to close down a few of his parlours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 2015, following the liquor policy of the then Oommen Chandy government, more than 700 bars in two-, three- and four-star hotels were closed down, after which many of them began functioning as wine and beer parlours. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sg/pgh/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Similar conditions were witnessed outside the Indian Overseas Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank in Preet Vihar area.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby Arora, a resident of Radheypuri told IANS: &amp;quot;I have my account in this branch of Punjab National Bank, but everyday the bank is running out of cash within two hours after opening in the morning.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many among the crowd argued with the security guard positioned outside the branch for not informing them that the bank had run out of cash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Out of desperation, many customers asked the guard to let them in to see for themselves that there was no cash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many customers complained that they were never informed if there was any cash left or not.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pradeep Bhanot, who runs a tiles shop in Jagatpuri area of east Delhi, said that he too was unable to make a single transaction from the bank or ATM kiosk in the last 10 days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's 15 December now, and I need to pay my workers here,&amp;quot; he said, adding, &amp;quot;Each and everyone of my staff don't have bank accounts. So I am facing a problem.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lashing out at the government, he said: &amp;quot;Most of the staff at my shop are illiterate and expecting e-banking from them is a cruel joke.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serpentine queues have been witnessed across the country after the government's November 8 decision to spike higher currency notes to curb &amp;quot;black money and corruption&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hundreds of people were also seen waiting outside ATMs in south Delhi's Kalkaji area early Thursday morning to get some cash from the HDFC and State Bank of Patiala branches, which were dispensing cash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expressing anger over the government's demonetisation move, Rahul Sharma, who runs a bike repairing shop in Govindpuri, termed the move a &amp;quot;cruel joke&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;aks/bns/ahm/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Tata Motors Employees Union has come out in support of Tata Sons' interim Chairman Ratan Tata and stated that they have lost faith in the leadership of ousted Chairman Cyrus Mistry.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 7,250-member-strong Union rubbished allegations made by Mistry in his letter to the shareholders of the group firms that a 'key reform measure' was undermined to get the trade unions' support.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Union, in a letter issued on Wednesday, stated that the loss of confidence in Mistry resulted from its members remaining unconvinced of the �Measure for Performance' initiative even after 16 meetings were held on the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Keeping in mind the fact that in spite of verbal assurance given by our seniors in the management that an amicable settlement would be arrived at within a fortnight and since over 15 months have passed with no concrete action taken, the Union has now lost faith in Mistry's leadership which is often deliberately misleading,&amp;quot; the letter from Tata Motors' Union stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emphasising the need for workmen and management to be two sides of a well-balanced equation in any company, the letter by the Union expressed shock that a person of Mistry's stature would resort to such 'immature actions'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The management and the workmen are not two opposites, but rather two sides of a well-balanced equation,&amp;quot; the letter elaborated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Henceforth, the Tata Motors Employees' Union and all its workmen will support Ratan Tata.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Tata Motors Union also denounced inferences in Mistry's earlier communication that their office bearers' calling on Tata would in turn impact the ongoing discussions between the management of Tata Motors and the Tata Motors Employees' Union on the &amp;quot;Productivity-Linked Wage Settlement&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Union, in its letter, termed the allegation as a 'lie' and said the meeting with Tata on November 10, 2016 was planned well in advance and not one to negotiate a deal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the meeting, Tata had appealed to all the workers of Tata Motors to work hard for the benefit of the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Union explained that it did not discuss any issue or topic related to long-term wage settlement.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The letter also specifically placed focus on the 'Settlements' of 2003, 2006 and 2009 under the leadership of Tata, where the Union had accepted quality, productivity, safety and profit-linked wage agreement linked to the prosperity of the company, which showed continuous improvements till 2012.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Union's letter comes a day after Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) removed Tata Sons' ousted Chairman Mistry from its board of Directors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Tuesday, more than 93 per cent shareholders of TCS had voted to remove Mistry as Director of the company in its extra-ordinary general meeting (EGM).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier, Tata Industries removed Mistry from its board of directors. The company had taken the decision at its EGM held on Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several other Tata Group companies, including Tata Motors, have called EGMs to decide whether or not to remove Mistry from their respective boards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On December 13, Tata Sons had hiked its stake in Tata Motors as it bought five crore additional shares at Rs 486.13 per share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the end of the last quarter on September 30, Tata Sons held 26.98 per cent stake in the company, while the complete promoter group had a holding of 33.01 per cent in Tata Motors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consolidation in Tata Sons' stake in its automobile subsidiary comes after Tata Motors called an EGM on December 22 to decide whether or not to remove Tata Sons' ousted Chairman Mistry as a Director from its board. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tata Sons had earlier asked Mistry to follow his own assertions on corporate governance and step down from the boards of Tata companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tata Sons' board ousted Mistry on October 24 and appointed Ratan Tata as the interim Chairman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ppg-rv/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Ranchi, Dec 15 (IANS) The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Jarkhand has shown generosity towards legislators by slashing interest rate on housing loan to a mere four per cent.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This announcement came as the Reserve Bank of India kept the interest rate unchanged, which was expected after demonetisation of high value currency notes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serving and former legislator will be able to get up to Rs 40 lakh housing loan at rate of 4 per cent per annum, said a decision cleared by the cabinet on Wednesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chief Minister Raghubar Das, however, was yet to come out with any relief measures for daily wage labourers, farmers and common people hit by the demonetisation decision and the resultant cash crunch across the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Das, after coming to power in December 2014, hiked the salary of legislators, Ministers, and others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In May 2015, the monthly salary of Jharkhand legislator was increased to Rs 210,333 from Rs 116,833. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ns/ahm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

But again, I do believe that we can get past that. Our nation is divided; we have been assaulted, it's an act of terrorism.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The video clip prompted outrage and threats to her life. In total, more than 1,000 emails and threatening phone calls were directed at Cox, OCC and her union, local media reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;News of threats against the professor came to light as hundreds of people held demonstrations on campus in support of and against her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/ahm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

But if they want to discuss it again, we are ready. They should follow certain rules and bring it on the agenda,&amp;quot; said Kharge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was speaking to the media in Parliament premises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also accused the government of taking up the issue to divert people's attention from the demonetisation issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They are raising Agusta Westland issue, they are displaying posters in the house. Their intention is to divert,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They are not ready to listen to us. We had also spoken to the Speaker on this.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kharge added: &amp;quot;They are creating ruckus. They are not allowing Rahul Gandhi to speak. The floor leaders of the opposition parties wanted to talk. They are also being stopped by the government's brute majority.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Today again adjournments happened after every five minutes. The government is running away from discussions. They want the winter session to get over without discussion,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sid/in/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) Embroidery is a great form of embellishment on any clothing styles. So this winter, experiment with these details on denims, leather jackets, boots and many others and lift up the look of your attire, says an expert.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yashodhara Shroff, Director and founder of online shopping store Styletag, shares five ways to incorporate embroidery into your wardrobe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* On denim:  Colourful embroidery on denim jackets, pants and bags stands out with great vigour and never fails to impress. If you're looking to experiment and love a pop of colour anytime of the day, these are perfect for you. Classroom doodle embroidery is great on western styles and floral on Indian styles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; * On leather: One could take their pick from an A- line leather skirt, a leather jacket, bags or pants. If you're looking for subtle detailing or a full-on embroidered piece, switching to embroidered leather in the form of a jacket or a practical shopping bag is a wise move to make.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; * On skirts: Nothing makes a statement like a perfect A-line embroidered skirt. Subtle and appealing embroidery on skirts is a class act as opposed to anything else. One can never go wrong with a detailed embroidered skirt when paired with a crisp white shirt. Splurge on some intricately detailed skirts as they will never go out of style.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; * On shoes: A favourite among street style aficionados, embroidery on shoes makes a perfect statement and gives your attire that oomph it requires. Embroidery on the tongue of the sneakers and decorative patterns on block heels and Indian flats like morjaris and jootis are a combination of shoe culture and ethnicity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;nv/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>&amp;quot;It is not a common practice or desirable culture for a Hindu son in India to get separated from his parents on getting married at the instance of the wife, especially when the son is the only earning member in the family,&amp;quot; the Supreme Court (SC) noted in a October 2016 judgement, while granting a divorce to a couple from Karnataka.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &amp;quot;In India, generally people do not subscribe to the western thought, where, upon getting married or attaining majority, the son gets separated from the family. In normal circumstances, a wife is expected to be with the family after the marriage. Normally, without any justifiable strong reason, she would never insist that her husband should get separated from the family and live only with her.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;That observation is echoed in new Census data, which reveals that 97 per cent of 224 million Indians who migrated after marriage are women.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Four of every 10 Indians (453 million) are migrants, according to the Census data. That is more than the combined population of the US, Germany and Canada.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Marriage is the most common purpose of migration with 49 per cent of them (224 million) migrating for marriage, followed by moving with households (15 per cent) and work/employment (10 per cent).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women migrate more for education but less for employment&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Of 46.4 million Indians who migrated for work/employment, 7.4 million (16 per cent) were female. No more than 27 per cent of Indian women are in the labour force, the second-lowest rate of female labour-force participation in South Asia after Pakistan, IndiaSpend reported in April 2016.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The labour force, however, doesn't include women who do &amp;quot;unpaid care work&amp;quot;, which refers to all unpaid services within a household, including care of people, housework and voluntary community work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;It appears that more females migrate for business than for employment. Of 4.3 million Indians migrating for business, 1.1 million (26 per cent) were female; 14 per cent of business establishments in India are run by female entrepreneurs, IndiaSpend reported in May 2016.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Females account for 40 per cent of Indians who migrate for education, reflecting a nationwide male dominance: As many as 1,403 females have never attended any educational institution for every 1,000 males who have not, IndiaSpend reported in November 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;78 per cent of rural female migrants move for marriage&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As many as 228 million females from rural areas are migrants, of which 179 million (78 per cent) migrated for marriage; the figure was 46 per cent for females from urban areas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Women from urban areas, on average, marry more than two years later than their rural counterparts, IndiaSpend reported in May 2015.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The median age at marriage among urban women was 18.8 years, according to the National Family Health Survey 2005-06, compared with 16.4 years among rural women. A quarter of all women aged 15 to 49 in urban areas have never been married, compared with 17 per cent of rural women.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;(In arrangement with IndiaSpend.org, a data-driven, non-profit, public interest journalism platform. Devanik Saha is an MA Gender and Development student at Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex. The views expressed are those of IndiaSpend.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 15 (IANS) Keeping people off the web would create &amp;quot;unacceptable&amp;quot; challenges to freedom of speech and commerce, a US diplomat said here on Thursday, underlining the need for every country to develop a culture of cyber security.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In Bangladesh, when people talk about cyber security they are often talking about how to prevent things from getting onto the web,&amp;quot; US Ambassador to Bangladesh Marcia Bernicat said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Keeping people off the web would create, major and, I would argue, unacceptable challenges to freedom of speech and freedom of commerce. We are increasingly relying on e-commerce,&amp;quot; Bernicat said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is incumbent upon every country in the world, and certainly the South Asian nations, to find a way to develop and instil a culture of cyber security that comes down to every individual,&amp;quot; Bernicat told the Indo-Asia Connectivity for Shared Prosperity conference here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The envoy also clarified that open borders did not necessarily create more insecurity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have seen even terrorists have learned to outsource their activities and they are doing it through internet. So, open borders don't create more insecurity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;If you have good anti-money-laundering laws and regulatory regime, then, we sovereign nations, working together can stop all forms of transnational crime but the most challenging in this day and age is cyber security,&amp;quot; the diplomat said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adding to the discourse, US Ambassador to Nepal Alaina B. Teplitz said it was necessary to strike a balance in enabling the good parts of the internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The fine line and balance to be looking for is how to enable the good parts of the internet and the ability for citizens to communicate, access services and obtain information.... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For the media to be able to present information and to engage in dialogue and looking very carefully at the regulatory efforts that are applied to the internet... to the online services or digital services to evaluate for unintended consequences,&amp;quot; Teplitz said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;US Ambassador to India Richard Verma said that, across Asia, it was really hard to have true connectivity in the digital area without adequate cyber security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The threats that we are facing in the cyber domain come from individuals who are maybe trying to steal information for their personal gain, they are coming from criminal networks that are exploiting people, &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They are coming from states that are looking to steal corporate secrets or steal other state's secrets and we really have to have adequate defences on that,&amp;quot; Verma said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/in/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) With Christmas around the corner, the holiday season has officially arrived for travel lovers.  While vacationing, clean and hygienic bathrooms must always be your priority and for this, keep in mind a few basic steps like using Indian seat toilets and using tissues while touching the doorknob, says an expert.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;KE Ranganathan, President, Sales and Marketing, Roca Bathroom Products Pvt Ltd, shares a few insights about what one should keep in mind while using public toilets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* First and foremost, avoid touching the toilet doorknob with bare hands. Door knobs carry germs from multiple sources and may cause infections. Try using a tissue paper for holding the knob from outside as well as inside before heading out or going in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Take care of your personal belongings. Germs touching your hands can be easily washed out but once they transmit to your belongings such as phone, handbags, etc, they might infect you. Avoid placing your handbags on the floors and hang it on the hook behind the doors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Always prefer an Indian seat toilet instead of the western style to avoid any direct contact with the toilet surfaces. In case you can't find one, hover over the seat without skin contact or make sure that you wipe the toilet seat before sitting on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Flush it, turn around and get out of the toilet. The probability of getting infected with air-borne germs and bacteria while flushing is very high. Always close the lid before you flush, take a small tissue to press the flush button and exit the place quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Avoid the use of hand dryer, how ever much it might attract you for a quick dry. The blow dryer giving out hot air has the ability to spread the germs present in the air around. To avoid getting infected even after washing hands thoroughly, use a paper towel to dry them. Carry a small handkerchief while you are on the go. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* In the end, use a hand sanitiser and you are good to go!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;nv/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Antony on Thursday said there were no skeletons in the UPA's closet pertaining to the AgustaWestland helicopter deal.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have nothing to hide, nothing to fear, no role in it. We are very clear,&amp;quot; Antony said outside Parliament.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Many a time in Parliament I have explained everything with documents about the whole thing.

Because this chopper is for the use of President, Vice President and Prime Minister. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The procurement was (to take place) because of consistent demand from the Indian Air Force from 1999.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the arrest of former Air Chief S.P. Tyagi, Aantony said: &amp;quot;Let them complete the inquiry. Let the truth come out.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BJP has been aggressively raising the issue of AgustaWestland in Parliament after the arrest of Tyagi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mak/ahm/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 15 (IANS) Chelsea boosted their lead over the rest of the English Premier League (EPL) with a 1-0 away-win against bottom-placed Sunderland, while Liverpool dominated Middlesbrough 3-0 to claim second place -- six points behind the leaders.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In other matches on Wednesday, Manchester United needed a late goal from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to prevail 2-1 over Crystal Palace. Ibrahimovic also had a part in the first goal, providing an assist to Paul Pogba, reports Efe news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manchester United are in sixth place, 13 points behind Chelsea, who tied their own record of 10 consecutive wins, set in 2005-2006. Current United coach Jose Mourinho was in charge of Chelsea at that time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cesc Fabregas, making his return to the starting 11 after a long absence, got the goal for Chelsea, though goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois also played a decisive role for the London club, making a pair of great saves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adam Lallana scored twice for Liverpool against Middlesbrough to bring the Reds to 34 points, the same as Arsenal, but the team from Merseyside enjoys a goal advantage over the Gunners, who slip to third place after losing 2-1 to Everton on Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fourth place are Manchester City, who got goals from Pablo Zabaleta and David Silva on Wednesday to top Watford 2-0 and end a two-match losing streak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tottenham Hotspur maintained their grip on the fifth spot, as Christian Eriksen contributed a brace in a 3-0 home win over Hull City.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day's outstanding offensive performance was delivered by Salomon Rondon, who posted a hat trick in West Bromwich Albion's 3-1 victory against Swansea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Better known for a stingy defence, West Brom has climbed to seventh place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Struggling West Ham United escaped relegation by defeating Burnley 1-0.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Indian equity markets traded on a flat note during the mid-afternoon trade session on Thursday, as negative global indices, coupled with profit booking and a weak rupee, subdued investors' sentiments.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, the equity markets discounted the much awaited decision of the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hike interest rates and brushed off their early losses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two benchmark indices, which opened in the red, pared some of their losses, but still traded on a flat note -- marginally in the green, as healthy buying was witnessed in IT, Teck (technology, media and entertainment) and banking stocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The wider 51-scrip Nifty of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) was up a tad by 2.55 points or 0.03 per cent at 8,185 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The barometer 30-scrip Sensitive Index (Sensex) of the BSE, which opened at 26,497.71 points, traded at 26,608.50 points (at 2.30 p.m.) -- inched-up 5.66 points or 0.02 per cent from the previous close at 26,602.84 points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sensex has so far touched a high of 26,737.86 points and a low of 26,407.58 points during the intra-day trade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The BSE market breadth was tilted in favour of the bulls -- with 1,355 advances and 1,145 declines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The much awaited US Federal rate hike was as expected by 25 bps (basis points), signalling more rate hikes in the next year. However, the markets discounted the rate hike and recovered from their earlier losses,&amp;quot; Astha Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Hem Securities, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The global indices were lower following the rate hike as the US dollar index showed a rise. Crude oil prices were also lower.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Dhruv Desai, Director and Chief Operating Officer of Tradebulls, the Nifty faced resistance at higher levels due to profit booking and firm USD/INR futures prices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;IT, banking and auto stocks traded with firm sentiments, whereas pharma, oil-gas, textile, aviation and media-entertainment stocks traded with bearish sentiments,&amp;quot; Desai elaborated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Cement stocks traded with firm sentiments, whereas FMCG and power stocks traded with mixed sentiments due to profit booking at higher levels.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Wednesday, the equity markets were suppressed by upcoming global economic events' risks and weak European indices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The barometer index was down 94.98 points or 0.36 per cent, while the NSE Nifty edged down by 39.35 points or 0.48 per cent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ppg-rv/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Los Angeles, Dec 15 (IANS) Popular chat show host Jimmy Kimmel has revealed that he will be paid $15,000 to anchor the 89th Academy Awards ceremony.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kimmel opened up about his salary for Oscars on KROQ's &amp;quot;Kevin &amp;amp; Bean&amp;quot; morning show on Wednesday, reports variety.com. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though the numbers may seem a bit low, compared to what he normally makes, Kimmel joked about the sum, saying: &amp;quot;I think it's illegal to pay nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I'm not sure I was supposed to reveal this. But nobody told me not to. I consider this their fault.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to &amp;quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&amp;quot;, the 49-year-old has also hosted his own Oscars aftershow within the last few years. The announcement that Kimmel would host seemed rather overdue, as the host for films' biggest night is usually announced months prior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They asked like 14 people and they all said no and then there was me. I absolutely was surprised,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 89th Academy Awards will take place on February 26, 2017, at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sas/rb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 15 (IANS) If you are running out of ideas for your New Year's resolution, consider running. Researchers have found that runners show greater functional connectivity in brain regions important for tasks such as planning and decision-making.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These activities (such as running) that people consider repetitive actually involve many complex cognitive functions -- like planning and decision-making -- that may have effects on the brain,&amp;quot; said one of the researchers David Raichlen, Associate Professor at University of Arizona, at Tucson in the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the researchers compared brain scans of young adults engaged in cross-country running to young adults who do not engage in regular physical activity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Participants were roughly the same age -- 18 to 25 -- with comparable body mass index and educational levels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The runners, overall, showed greater functional connectivity -- or connections between distinct brain regions -- within several areas of the brain, including the frontal cortex, which is important for cognitive functions such as planning, decision-making and the ability to switch attention between tasks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, suggest that running may affect the structure and function of the brain in ways similar to complex tasks like playing a musical instrument.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since functional connectivity often appears to be altered in ageing adults, and particularly in those with Alzheimer's or other neurodegenerative diseases, it is an important measure to consider, Gene Alexander, Professor at University of Arizona, noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 15 (IANS) The northeast today is virtually free from the problem of insurgency and investors should look at exploiting the multiple opportunities the region offers, Rajya Sabha member from Mizoram Ronal Sapa Tlau has said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at an open house discussion on &amp;quot;Act East Now&amp;quot; organised by Assocham here on Wednesday, Tlau said his state suffered from insurgency for 20 years starting till 1986.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;People tend to think that the northeast is still facing the problem of insurgency,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But Mizoram is today the most people region in the country now.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Congress MP said though Mizoram was still 20 years behind the rest of the country in terms of development, the issue of connectivity with the state was by and large being solved by three big projects - broad gauge railhead, rail connectivity from Kolkata and the Kaladan multi-modal transport project connecting Sittwe port in Myanmar with the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He identified four agricultural and horticultural products investors could invest in his state - asparagus, passion fruit, dragon fruit and kiwi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also said that bamboo was another sector that could be exploited in the region with its uses in furniture, flooring and textiles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CPI-M Lok Sabha member from Tripura, Jitendra Choudhury, said each northeastern state had a variety of fruits and vegetables &amp;quot;but the amount we produce today can be increased by at least 10 times&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He pointed out that Tripura was the second largest producer of rubber in the country after Kerala.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the region's biodiversity and variety of culture, Choudhury said tourism was another area that could be developed in a major way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also stressed on the power generation capacity of the region with Tripura and Meghalaya already being self-sufficient and Arunachal Pradesh having the potential to generate 100,000 MW.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Choudhury said that with its large English-speaking manpower, the northeast was ideal for the IT industry and BPO sector. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this connection, he reminded the participants that after Chennai and Mumbai, Tripura now has the third internet gateway in the country via Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Congress Rajya Sabha Member from Assam, Bhubaneswar Kalita, said that prior to independence, the British invested in sectors like tea and oil in his state despite there being virtually no infrastructure then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have the world's oldest oil refinery (in Digboi). We developed all these even when there was no infrastructure,&amp;quot; Kalita said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that the northeast has a lot of potential in terms of natural resources and human resource but lamented that after independence, foreign direct investment had not come to the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Congress Lok Sabha member from Meghalaya, Vincent Pala, said that in agriculture &amp;quot;we earlier looked at only rice and maize, but now we are growing cash crops and flowers&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stating that airports in the northeast were getting modernised, he sought a proposal from the business community for drafting an ease-of-doing business policy in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier, in his opening remarks, D.S. Rawat, Secretary General of Assocham, said that his organisation had opened a liaison office in the northeast and he personally had visited every state in the region.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He stressed on herbal development and entrepreneurial training, particularly in the food processing sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Other areas he focussed on were small and medium enterprises, organic farming and solar energy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ab/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 15 (IANS) A cost-effective saliva test may have the potential to act as non-invasive marker of immunity and thus enable assessment of vaccination and protection against bacterial infections such as pneumococcal infections in the human body, a study has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saliva test can be an attractive method of specimen collection particularly for children and the elderly, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Saliva sampling is non-invasive, requires no specialist training or equipment, and may be more cost-effective,&amp;quot; said lead author Jennifer Heaney from the University of Birmingham in Britain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study showed that IgG Pn antibodies in saliva correlated with antibody levels in serum in infants.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protection against bacterial infection is usually inferred by measuring antibody levels in blood serum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But taking blood samples involves a number of logistical considerations and may not always be feasible, especially in developing countries or where children are involved. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The suggestion that antibody levels in saliva may be indicative of those in serum therefore has important implications for markers of immunity and vaccination in many parts of the world,&amp;quot; Heaney added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous research showed that lower levels of antibodies in saliva are associated with of an elevated risk of mortality, and that saliva sampling to determine IgA secretion rate has the potential to be used as an indicator of overall health by professionals as part of a general check-up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, samples of both blood and saliva were taken from 72 healthy adults. Samples were then analysed to test for concentrations of IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies against 12 pneumococcal (Pn) antigens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results showed that in general, higher antibody concentrations in serum were associated with higher concentrations in saliva, with the strongest relationships observed for IgA antibodies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was published in the journal Biomarkers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/sm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Film: &amp;quot;Shor Se Shuruaat&amp;quot;; Directors: Rahul V Chittella, Amira Bhargava, Annie Zaidi, Pratik Rajen Kothari, Supriya Sharma, Arunima Sharma, Satish Raj; Cast: Atul Kulkarni, Sakshi Tanwar, Siddharth Menon, Nandu Madhav, Aayushi Lahiri, Sanjay Mishra, Rasika Dugal, Bobby Parvez, Suchitra Pillai, Pawan Manda Kale, Manjiri V Pupala, Baia Marbaniang; Rating: **1/2&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Shor Se Shuruaat&amp;quot; is an anthology of seven indie shorts, whose fledgling directors were hand-picked and mentored by veterans of the Hindi film industry. Released under the HumaraMovie banner, the title of the film is an apt self-proclamation of creating the buzz for its budding directors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each story, though different, deals with human emotions, but they are bound by a common theme - &amp;quot;Shor&amp;quot; or noise. And every film has the distinct flavour of its mentor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film starts rolling with &amp;quot;Azad&amp;quot;. Directed by Rahul V Chittella and mentored by Mira Nair, it is a layered drama that is intensely narrated in a non-linear fashion. It is the tautly told story of a father-son relationship which also unravels the trials and tribulations of a principled man, who reluctantly becomes a columnist, writing under the pseudonym - Azad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the back and forth narrative that gets a bit confusing at times. Atul Kulkarni as Vinod Durge and Sakshi Tanwar as his Muslim wife Zainab are an extension of themselves. And the character who essays their son Sameer, is competent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With baited breath you wait for the second, &amp;quot;Aamer&amp;quot; -- directed by Amira Bhargava and mentored by Zoya Akhtar. This one tells us the story of a deaf boy named Aamer, who lives on the streets of Mumbai. It is a slice of his life tale which reveals how, devoid of sound, he romances the city. In his endeavour to lead a normal life, Aamer with the help of his mother, acquires a hearing aid. After which, instead of being thrilled about being able to hear, how he is disappointed, forms the crux of this tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though well executed in a formulaic graph, the film exhibits a sense of familiarity and thus loses out on the novelty factor. The little boy who plays Aamer is charming, but lacks charisma and thus fails to tug at your emotional chords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third film, &amp;quot;Decibel&amp;quot; -- directed by Annie Zaidi and mentored by Sriram Raghavan -- is set in a dystopian society, in the future, where citizens are forced to live within a minimum audible threshold. The story follows a girl who is craving for sounds like in the &amp;quot;good-ole days&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treated as a science fiction in a synthetic atmosphere, the film seems a tad superficial with a pretentious and absurd tale. On the performance front, the actors essay their parts effortlessly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Hello Hello&amp;quot;, directed by Pratik Rajen Kotari and mentored by Shyam Benegal, is an intelligently scripted satire about consumerism. It showcases the noise created by competing organisations to lure consumers. Strategically placed in the anthology, the film, brings with it nuggets of light moments that elevate the sagging viewing spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With an undoubtedly intense performance from Sanjay Mishra, as a convict in solitary confinement, waiting patiently with hope and silence before he is marched to the gallows, the film &amp;quot;Dhvani&amp;quot; -- directed by Supriya Sharma and mentored by Nagesh Kukunoor is astutely handled, and the prisoner's anxiety is palpable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Treated as a fairy tale, &amp;quot;Yellow Tin Can Telephone&amp;quot;, directed by Arunima Sharma and mentored by Homi Adajania, is the tale of a unique boy and a girl whose lives are diametrically opposite. She suffers from an overdeveloped sense of hearing and he from an overdeveloped sense in association with colours. How their paths cross and they trade their secrets, forms the crux of this tale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creatively mounted in a montage narrative, the film is layered with glossed up frames and a verbose and lyrical narrative. The story may seem strange and silly but nevertheless, you cannot dismiss this film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final film in English, &amp;quot;Mia I'm&amp;quot;, directed by Satish Raj and mentored by Imtiaz Ali, is packed with a strong message targeting the youth of today. It is the story of Mia, who, lured with promises of a bright romantic future is forced to live like a ghost, because she is emotionally dead. How she takes charge of her life after her trauma, forms the crux of this tale. The film is motivational with an upbeat spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All films, made on moderate production values, excel in the technical aspects, especially the sound department.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, this film is worth a watch to encourage these budding directors and to know the type of films these directors will churn out in future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;troy/rb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Damascus, Dec 15 (IANS) The evacuation of rebels remaining in the Syrian city of Aleppo will start soon, the Syrian army said on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following intense negotiations, a ceasefire returned in place for the evacuation of the rebels from the few areas they were still holding in the eastern part of Aleppo city, Xinhua reported, adding that the evacuation will start within hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Preparations were going on for the evacuation of the rebels from eastern Aleppo towards the town of Khan Tuman, southwest of Aleppo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the first convoy of wounded people started leaving eastern Aleppo towards the government-controlled area west of the city.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The London-based watchdog group noted that the rebel convoys had not started leaving yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rebel evacuation from the few areas under their control in eastern Aleppo comes as a result of a Turkish-Russian deal, which was supposed to begin on Wednesday, but was delayed and shooting resumed for undeclared reasons, before Thursday morning, as the deal seemed in place again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ahm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Nairobi, Dec 15 (IANS) When the 2016 Kenyan Premier League (KPL) football champions, Tusker FC, feted their season's top performers, one man quietly followed the proceedings more keenly than those who were in a celebratory mood.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former Kenyan international Boniface Ambani sat round a table in a terse mood, his body language depicting that of a man in a moment of nostalgia, reports Xinhua news agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the team's top striker, Allan Wanga, was invited to receive the award of the team's season top-scorer, after he scored eight goals since he moved to Tusker in the mid-season transfer window, Ambani stood and clapped, happy that someone followed into his footsteps, or afraid that his record was on the line.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he turned up for Tusker FC in 2007, Ambani, then 24, scored 26 goals to set a national record of the most goals scored by one player in a single season of the KPL, and which still stands to date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With that scintillating goal-scoring form, Tusker won their eighth league title. &amp;quot;KPL today has a lot of talent, but still lacks goal scorers who can surpass my 10-year record,&amp;quot; Ambani told Xinhua in a recent interview.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;During my time when football was challenging, we would play two matches in one weekend but despite the fatigue, goals would come. Today, the league lacks players who are anchored on discipline, consistency and respect,&amp;quot; Ambani said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said football has developed in the country but still lacked players with consistent finish, hence the reason no player has equalled his 26 goals, he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ambani played for several clubs in Kenya and abroad before an Achilles tendon injury sent him into early retirement, ending his short stint with Chinese side Xian City FC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Decrying the goal-shy strikers in the current league, Ambani advises current players to keep their focus, noting that is the reason he also scored many goals with Yanga Sports of Tanzania where he netted 24 goals to win the Tanzanian Premier League Golden Boot in 2008.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;After retirement, I have remained relevant in football as a businessman dealing in sports apparel,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ambani, an accountant by profession, is the proprietor of Botchend Sports shops and has established himself as the main supplier of sports equipment and uniforms to most KPL teams and signed a contract with his former club, AFC Leopards as their chief merchandise supplier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He started the business after selling pairs of uniforms he brought along from China after which he opened sports shops in Eldoret town and Nairobi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ambani, whose passion for AFC Leopards can barely be hidden, has won more Golden Boots than any other striker in the last two decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was winner of the KPL Golden Boot in 2002 after he scored 16 goals for Oserian FC. He won it again in 2005 after he netted 18 goals for Kenya Pipeline; his record 26 goals for Tusker FC in 2007; and in 2008 when he scored 24 goals for Yanga FC in the Tanzanian Premier League.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the same year, Ambani scooped the Tanzania Sports Personality Award (TASWA) that rewards the Best Sportsman of the Year in all sports disciplines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ambani played for AFC Leopards in the 1998 KPL season emerging the second highest goal scorer after taking his tally to 14 goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He scored 13 goals for Oserian in 2003; 16 goals for Yanga in 2010; and 17 goals while playing his trade in Oman in 2005.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He earned 35 national team caps and scored 17 times before retiring from international football.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ajb/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 15 (IANS) Fresh archaeological evidence found in Mumbai has provided some missing historical links from 100 BC to the 12th century AD, indicating that development of the area started long before the 15th century advent of the Portuguese, a top expert said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the Mumbai-Salsette Archaeological Exploration Project, 2015-2016, funded by India Study Centre Trust (INSTUCEN Trust) a team of researchers from Mumbai University\'s Centre for Extra-Mural Studies (CEMS) and PTVA-Sathaye College students explored ancient temples, historical sites and old communities in what is now Greater Mumbai.

They discovered, among other things, pre-historic tools, inscriptions, relics, pillars, land grant stones, Gadhegals (engraved stones), and seven new caves inside the 2,000-year old Kanheri Caves complex of suburban Borivali.

\&amp;quot;This and other evidence, ancient records and field research provide the historical links that appeared to have snapped from 100 BC to the 12th century,\&amp;quot; said CEMS Director Mugdha D. Karnik.

Effectively, she said this pushes back history by three-four centuries, shattering the hitherto-held belief that the development of the region began from the Portuguese era, starting with the landing of Vasco da Gama in Calicut in May 1498.

Many of the new discoveries in the Mumbai metropolitan region, comprising Mumbai-Salsette, shed light on the little-known pre-Portuguese era and would require deeper research to connect them to a glorious past, Karnik added.

Salsette is bound to the north by the Bassein Creek, to the northeast by Ulhas River, to the east by Thane Creek and Mumbai Harbour, and to the south and the west by the Arabian Sea. They were gradually merged by massive land reclamation during the 19th-20th centuries to form Bombay, now called Mumbai.

Karnik stumbled upon this older history almost accidentally when she casually enquired of C.K. Salunkhe, head of horticulture at BARC, whether there were any archaeological remnants in the premises of the country\'s first atomic plant which is situated in a part of the old Salsette.

Surprisingly, Salunkhe brought out an ancient inscription and a sandstone Shikhara, which was examined by the research team of Karnik, Kurush F. Dalal, Suraj Pandit and journalist-cum-archaeologist Vinayak Parab and others.

\&amp;quot;The inscription bears clear references to the Sultan of Delhi, a local vassal of Bimba Dynasty, Hambir Rao; the place is stated as Konkan-Bimbasthana, with names of villages which exist even today like Marol, Nanale (BARC), Devnare (Deonar),\&amp;quot; Parab explained.

The reference points to Salsette or Sashti in the word \&amp;quot;Sansathi\&amp;quot;, bearing a clear date \&amp;quot;Kartika Shuddha Dwadashi, Saka Samvat 1290\&amp;quot; (corresponding to November 3, 1368).

It is quite likely that the etymology of Mumbai-Bombay-Bombahem originated from Bimbasthana, according to the research paper.

Dalal said past studies showed the area\'s urbanisation started only with the arrival of the Portuguese, but the new discoveries and archaeological artefacts prove it to be much older.

An exciting dimension to the project was the discovery of seven new caves in the Kanheri complex, located deep inside the 100 sq km Sanjay Gandhi National Park in northern Mumbai, by Parab, Pandit and others.

The Kanheri Caves, 109 in total, date from the 1st century BC to the 10th century, and became a Buddhist settlement of global importance by the 3rd century.

Usually accessible from the western side (Borivali), Parab and his team entered it from the eastern side (Mulund) and were rewarded with pre-historic microliths in the Tulsi Lake area and larger stone tools at Khindipada that are \&amp;quot;believed to be over 30,000 years old\&amp;quot;, Karnik said.

They also found a Gadhegal -- also known as Ass-curse Stone as they depict donkeys in sexual union with human women -- which was on the verge of being discarded in the Powai Lake, and some other artefacts were found in Aarey Milk Colony.

In fact, the team found sculptures, some dating to the Shilahara Dynasty (765-1029) in the Marol area which was its commercial capital and is today a bustling Mumbai CBD, besides ancient temple pillars (of the same era) located near the old Aarey Milk Colony toll-plaza.

The field work of Dalal\'s team in the Thane-Ghodbunder area revealed centuries-old relics, old cannons and even remnants of an old and forgotten railway line.

These and other findings are on display in a four-day public expo at Mumbai University\'s Kalina Campus from Thursday.

Incidentally, another researcher, Siddharth Kale, said that Sopara was an ancient port and administrative centre falling in Salsette, with mention in many ancient inscriptions and literature from the 1st century BC till the 14th century.

It is also the only site known till now in the entire coastal Konkan region where human habitation flourished uninterrupted for more than 23 centuries and is today a bustling suburb on the Western Railway\'s suburban network, just before Virar.

Encouraged by the new discoveries, Karnik said her team plans to continue research and field studies over the next two-three years and hope to establish more missing links in Mumbai\'s ancient history and origins.

Then it will move a notch higher and stage the 2018 event as a WRC Candidate Event which will be observed by the FIA and WRC promoters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We will give out funds to see that these events are a success to the standards set by FIA. The Government will provide $1 million to facilitate this in 2017,&amp;quot; Ekai said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Sound financial, material and logistical support will be discussed at an inter-ministerial level through laid down protocol,&amp;quot; Ekai added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Todt, a former Safari Rally co-driver and later team principal of Peugeot World Rally Team, said that at a personal level he would like to see the Safari back in the WRC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said President Uhuru Kenyatta reassured him of his government's support when he met him last year at State House in Nairobi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He added that the WRC status are determined by the WRC Promoter who are the commercial rights holders of this global event with a cumulative global television reach of 755 million people in over 300 television stations in 150 countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is unacceptable to have over 17,000 road accidents, including 3,000 deaths, in Kenya annually.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi/Kohima, Dec 15 (IANS) The distant Baltic nation of Estonia was among the first in the world to put the governments\'s entire citizen-centric services online. Now, the northeastern state of Nagaland is attempting to replicate this to not only improve governance but also to emerge as the IT hub of the region.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;The e-Governance initiatives taken by the Department of Information Technology and Communication (IT&amp;C) of Nagaland is a forward-looking strategy and the recent award to Nagaland as a top performer in e-governance by the Computer Society of India is a great move towards the state\'s objectives,\&amp;quot; said Liia Hanni, Adviser to the Estonian President and part of the country\'s delegation to the just-concluded second e-Naga Summit in state capital Kohima.

Hailing Nagaland for being a top performer on e-governance in the northeastern region, Estonia, during the summit, also extended technical support to help the state better its e-Governance initiatives.

Estonian delegates explained the many areas in which government officials, apart from the people, can be trained to further promote e-Governance -- the only way to ease existing, hassling and cumbersome procedures and simultaneously usher in transparency and accountability.

Among the benefits will be e-tendering, better tracking of the increasing cyber crimes in the state, better monitoring of revenue collection and, most importantly, the elimination of touts that exist for each and every government procedure.

Thus, the perception of Nagaland -- till now known for its decades-long separatist conflict -- will not only change for the outside world but will also project the state as a potential IT hub by inviting MNCs to set up operations there.

(For the record, Estonia\'s e-governance systems were put in place during the Soviet era and refined when the country joined the European Union after the collapse of the USSR.)

According to official records, Nagaland is the only state in the entire country to have portals of all the departments of the state government.

E-Governance \&amp;quot;also ensures cost-effective public service delivery to the citizens. Nagaland is witnessing a paradigm shift in governance and all other spheres of life and information technology and electronic media is enabling knowledge-led economy,\&amp;quot; said Paiwang Konyak, Nagaland\'s Minister for IT&amp;C, adding that the initiative is playing a key role in transforming Nagaland into a modern state by improving transparency and efficiency.

At the e-Naga summit, a brainchild of Nagaland\'s Telecom Secretary and Commissioner K.D. Vizo, every year experts from various areas like engineers, legislators, police and media meet to encourage the spirit of innovation and use of technology for positive change in society, with the target audience comprising students, entrepreneurs, NGOs, government departments and industry professionals.

Vizo is also of the opinion that to improve internet connectivity in Nagaland, the government can opt for a High Altitude Platform Station (HAPS) -- that can be operated from an unmanned airship or a balloon for wider internet connectivity at a cheaper cost than incurred through other means.

Surely, Nagaland is the state to watch!

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Los Angeles, Dec 15 (IANS) Actress Megan Fox is reportedly eyeing the role of Poison Ivy in DC comics's upcoming &amp;quot;Gotham City Sirens&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sources at Bleeding Cool website have speculated that the actress may already line up for the villain's role. The site claims that she is a fan of the comic books, pointing out that the proof lies in Fox purchasing pre-52 Harley Quinn comics that feature the red-haired supervillainess, reports aceshowbiz.com. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Entertainment company Warner Bros has not given any comment regarding the report. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As of now, the only actress attached to the project is Margot Robbie, who will reprise her role as Harley Quinn. Plot details are still scarce, but the movie is said to focus on &amp;quot;the top female villains from the DC stable&amp;quot; who also include Catwoman. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Suicide Squad&amp;quot; helmer David Ayer will direct the film, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet (a yet untitled Tomb Raider reboot, &amp;quot;Sherlock Holmes 3&amp;quot;) providing the screenplay. The studio has yet to set a release date but the project is on the fast track. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fox is no stranger to playing comic book characters. Aside from the &amp;quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&amp;quot; movie series, she starred in &amp;quot;Jonah Hex&amp;quot; as Lilah/Tallulah Black and on &amp;quot;Robot Chicken&amp;quot; DC Comics TV special as Louis Lane. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She is also well known for her role as Mikaela Banes in the first two &amp;quot;Transformers&amp;quot; movies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;dc/rb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 15 (IANS) Is your child spending more than five hours on digital devices such as tablets and smartphones? A new study warns that he or she may be 43 per cent more likely to be at risk of obesity.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that adolescents who spent more than five hours a day on screen devices were twice as likely to have a sugary drink every day and not get enough sleep or indulge in any kind of physical activity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Such children were nearly 43 per cent more likely to have obesity compared with adolescents who did not spend time on these devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This study would suggest that limiting children's and adolescents' engagement with other screen devices may be as important for health as limiting television time,&amp;quot; said Erica L. Kenney from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the team included 24,800 adolescents from the US in grades 9-12.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results showed that nearly 20 per cent of adolescents spent more than five hours a day on smartphones, tablets, computers and video games compared with only 8 per cent children watching television.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watching too much television continued to be associated with obesity and poor diet among adolescents, the researchers said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study is coming up in The Journal of Pediatrics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/sm/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Guwahati, Dec 15 (IANS) Poachers have killed yet another one-horned rhino in Assam's Kaziranga National Park and took away its horn, officials said on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Park officials said the incident came to notice on Thursday morning when the guards recovered the carcass of the rhino from the park's Burhaphar range. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rhino horn was missing, which indicated poaching, park officials said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the 16th one-horned rhino to be killed by poachers in the park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We suspect the rhino was killed on Wednesday night. The involvement of militant outfits is suspected as we have recovered empty cartridges of AK- 47 rifles from near the carcass,&amp;quot; a senior park official told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the government claims to have taken several steps to stop the menace, the poachers continue to kill the animal for its horn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ah/pgh/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>
