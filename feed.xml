<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 3 (IANS) Barely three months after one of its rockets blew up on the launchpad - destroying a $200 million Facebook satellite with it - SpaceX has said that it plans to try again on January 8.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new launch date was included in a report on Monday that SpaceX released on the explosion of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on September 1, NBC news reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &amp;quot;anomaly&amp;quot; - SpaceX's word - was caused when supercold helium led carbon fibres and aluminium to cool at different rates on the second of the rocket's two stages, the company said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That opened the gaps between two layers of the overwrap, where liquid oxygen escaped and got trapped, it said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That, in turn, caused one of the protective layers to &amp;quot;buckle,&amp;quot; or fail. Static ignited the trapped oxygen, setting off a chain of catastrophic explosions, SpaceX said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Falcon rocket was to have launched an AMOS-6 communications satellite for a Facebook-Eutelsat joint venture to extend Internet access to underserved parts of the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said he was &amp;quot;deeply disappointed&amp;quot; by the loss but promised that &amp;quot;we will keep working until everyone has the opportunities this satellite would have provided.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SpaceX, a private space venture run by billionaire inventor Elon Musk, said Monday that its engineers have managed to rejigger the configuration of the rocket's helium containers, moderating the temperature of the helium and presumably eliminating buckling in the overwrap layer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it's successful, the next launch, tentatively schedule for Sunday at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, will put 10 satellites into orbit to upgrade and replace some of the units in the Iridium Communications satellite constellation, a system of 66 satellites that provide voice and data coverage around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;in/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Jan 3 (IANS) Google dedicated a Doodle on Tuesday to mark the 186th birth anniversary of India\'s 19th century social reformer Savitribai Jyotirao Phule, considered the first feminist of the country.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Savitribai K. Patil was born on January 3, 1831, in a rich and influential farming family and at the age of nine was married off to the 13-year old Jyotirao Phule.

She was taught to read and write by her husband and when she turned 17, the couple founded India\'s first school for girls and women in Bhidewada, Pune.

It started with just nine girls from different castes enrolled as students - but it became a historic step when female education was considered taboo in the orthodox Indian society prevalent then.

The Phule couple - who had no children of their own - launched a crusade against social discrimination based on caste and gender, and sparked the flame for women\'s equal rights during the British ruled India.

At a time when women had no say in anything, Savitribai\'s campaign covered child marriages, child widows, rape victims becoming pregnant, the practice of \'Sati\', educating women and fighting for equal rights for all women.

The colourful Doodle shows a simple Savitribai spreading her sari \'pallu\' wide to encompass women from all sections of society for education and empowerment.

The simple \'Goodle\' (Google Doodle) shows a group of demure women assembled outside what could be a school for education in a skyblue starry background which also doubles as her blouse.

Over the next few years, the Phules set up 18 more schools across the state of which Savitribai became the teacher, headmistress and principal.

Nearly 18 decades later, the Maharashtra government renamed the Pune University as \'Savitribai Phule University\' as a tribute to the Phule\'s sheer courage and pioneering efforts in the field of education, women empowerment, social reform and gender equality.

The procedure was very delicate and took a couple of hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussing the procedure, Munzer said: &amp;quot;An electrode is implanted in the inner ear where the child is able to hear sounds for the first time. Gradually, with the help of special software, sounds are adjusted to near normal level. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This would eventually help Nafiya hear all the sounds and cope with the communication demands,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharjah TV sponsored the cost of the procedure for the Indian expatriate girl. A cochlear implant costs about $40,840.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Now my daughter can hear us speak. She will listen to music, the birds sing and all the sounds of the world. This is a special day for our family and is one we will never forget,&amp;quot; Nafiya's father was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/mr&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 2 (IANS) The results of the investigation into what caused Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to catch fire are likely to be released this month, industry sources said on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement is most likely to be made on January 10 or by the end of January at the latest, Yonhap news agency reported citing source with knowledge of the matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The South Korean tech giant asked the US-based safety organisation UL to find the root cause of phablets catching fire. It halted its sales over recurring battery problems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Separately, the state-run Korea Testing Laboratory (KTL) also launched its own investigation into components of Samsung's latest flagship phones after numerous reports of the device igniting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although the investigation has been separately conducted by the two sides, it is mostly likely for the KTL to announce the final result, the sources said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have not yet confirmed the outcome of UL's investigation,&amp;quot; said a KTL official without further elaborating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government and Samsung reportedly concluded the cause is not a simple battery malfunction, and the two sides are fine-tuning details to reach the final outcome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finding the exact cause of the Note 7's problem is crucial for Samsung to win back consumers' trust before the firm launches its new flagship model, the Galaxy S8, in April, industry watchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Samsung Electronics must transform itself after learning an expensive lesson last year,&amp;quot; Kwon Oh-hyun, Vice Chairman and CEO of Samsung, said on Monday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The South Korean government, meanwhile, said it would strengthen its safety measures to prevent a similar problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The government is preparing a revision to safety regulations to prevent a similar accident from occurring,&amp;quot; a government official said on the condition of anonymity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bhubaneswar, Jan 2 (IANS) India on Monday successfully test fired the nuclear-capable  Agni IV ballistic missile from the Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The missile was launched at about 11.50 a.m., from a mobile launcher off the Balasore coast, defence sources said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is sixth test of the missile and second user associate launch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two-stage solid-propelled, surface-to-surface ballistic missile is designed to carry a 1-tonne payload to a distance of 4,000 km.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The test comes within a week of the successful test firing of Agni V intercontinental ballistic missile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has designed and developed the missile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The missile's length is 20 meters and launches weight 17 tonnes. It is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies, which include indigenously developed ring laser gyro and composite rocket motor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agni-IV has undergone one failed and five successful tests over the course of five years, said sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;cd/ksk/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 2 (IANS) As an earlier statement said WhatsApp will stop working on certain phones by the end of 2016, many users of older versions of iPhones and Android handsets are about to find themselves cut off from using the chat app, media has reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WhatsApp, with more than one billion monthly users, had earlier announced that it was phasing out compatibility with older phones in a technology upgrade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in the Independent on Monday, WhatsApp said that the move had been made to ensure that the app could continue to introduce new features and stay secure, which relies on the app being used on newer operating systems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the developing markets where the chat app and older phones are popular, WhatsApp has faced a sharp criticism for its move.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WhatsApp had initially listed all BlackBerry models and some Nokia handsets among the handsets that would be blocked from the chat app. However, the company retracted late last year, apparently in response to complaints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are extending support for BlackBerry OS, BlackBerry 10, Nokia S40 and Nokia Symbian S60 until June 30, 2017,&amp;quot; WhatsApp wrote in an update to its blog.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The service will stop on any first, second, third or fourth generation iPad that has not been updated. Users need to update to iOS 9.3 to use the service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With these changes, WhatsApp is expected to more deeply integrate encryption and other privacy services. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Such technology stops messages from being read, and has led to WhatsApp facing criticism from governments who believe that WhatsApp conversations should be made public,&amp;quot; the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/ksk/ap&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Jan 2 (IANS) The exodus of high-profile executives at Twitter continues In China as the company's managing director in the country, Kathy Chen, has quit.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Now that the Twitter APAC (Asia-Pacific) team is working directly with Chinese advertisers, this is the right time for me to leave the company,&amp;quot; Chen tweeted. Chen had joined Twitter in April, 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter was not able to legally operate in China due to a government-imposed ban in place. However, the company opened up a Hong Kong office in 2015 to pursue Chinese advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Chen was brought on board to oversee this effort and to find ways for developers and other businesses in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to be able to use the platform,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chen said that since Twitter and Chinese advertisers had developed a relationship, her job was done. She added that the advertiser-base in China had grown nearly 400 per cent over the past two years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in the VentureBeat, Chen did not disclose her future plans, except to say in a tweet that she would &amp;quot;take some time off to recharge, study about different cultures and then pursue more international business opportunities.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier, Twitter's Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain, Chief Technology Officer Adam Messinger and its vice President for products Josh McFarland also quit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter is going through a major overhaul under CEO Jack Dorsey as many top-notch executives have quit the company in the recent past. Dorsey brought in two board members in a bid to revive the company and earn the trust of investors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter editorial director Karen Wickre and Shariq Rizvi, who co-founded the direct response ads team at Twitter, both announced their departures in 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ksk&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

I find being a mum so rewarding but it can be overwhelming and lonely,&amp;quot; Ljungstrom said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ljungstrom's idea behind sharing the video of her labour was to show the other pregnant women how it went. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She added that she always looked for help and advice especially about the big things like labour and feeding that she was anxious about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ljungstrom later named her newborn daughter Eveline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ksk/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 2 (IANS) Despite the  Note 7 fiasco, Samsung Electronics Co is likely to report market forecast-beating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2016, helped by robust sales in its chip business, industry sources said on Monday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the data compiled by industry tracker FnGuide, market consensus for the operating income of the South Korean tech company is around $6.5 billion in the October-December period, compared to $4.31 billion posted a quarter earlier, Yonhap news agency reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many local securities firms, however, raised their earnings outlook beyond  $6.63 billion for the tech behemoth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a note to clients, IBK Securities predicted Samsung's fourth-quarter operating income will reach $7.21 billion, up by 68 per cent from a quarter earlier, on the back of the recovering demand for memory chips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industry watchers estimate the tech behemoth would rake in some $3.31 billion in operating profit solely from its chip business division.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsung, the world's largest maker of memory chips, saw its semiconductor business report an operating profit of $2.79 billion during the July-September period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tech firm is also forecast to log $1.66 billion in the IT and mobile division in the fourth quarter, the sources said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hit by the discontinuation of the firm's flagship smartphone Galaxy Note 7, Samsung posted an operating profit of only $82.83 million from its mobile business during the July-September quarter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsung will announce its fourth-quarter earnings guidance on Friday, company officials said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 2 (IANS) Chinese smartphone maker Coolpad has done well with smartphones that are targeted at those who look for devices in the sub-Rs 10,000 category. Continuing the legacy, the company has launched Coolpad Mega 3 that comes with the capability to hold three 4G-ready SIM cards.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At Rs 6,999, the device is a successor to the Coolpad Mega 2.5D.

Here is what works for the device.

Encased in a plastic exterior, the smartphone has a coarse back cover unlike its predecessor that came with a glossy back which made it difficult to hold in a single hand, given its large size. The phone comes in champagne white, moondust grey and gold white colour variants.

The Mega 3 sports a 5.5-inch IPS HD (1280 x 720 pixel) display which is quite common for devices in this range.

The device is driven by its custom user interface (UI) on top of Android 6.0 Marshmellow and is powered by quad-core MediaTek MT6737 processor -- a good combination for a phone at this price range. The device has 2GB RAM and 16GB on-board memory which can be extended up to 32GB.

The phone runs smoothly unless you shuffle between multiple applications, especially during a game.

With a 3,050mAh battery, the Mega 3 can run up to 10-15 hours under moderate use which is fair considering the large screen size.

The 8MP front camera takes good selfies even in low light without using a flash. The 8MP primary camera works fine in outdoor conditions, but in low-light conditions, the quality of photos is not great.

What doesn\'t work?

The device disappoints while playing HD videos as the colours appear dull. Playing heavy games on the device slowed its performance.

Conclusion: Coolpad\'s Mega 3 is for consumers who want a decent performing, selfie-camera phone with a large screen at an affordable price.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Jan 2 (IANS) US President-elect Donald Trump will continue using Twitter with the same gusto he has displayed to date because his tweets get &amp;quot;results&amp;quot;, the mogul's future Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Sunday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EFE news quoted Spicer as telling ABC that the President-elect did not need to have his comments filtered through the &amp;quot;mainstream media&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You know, with all due respect, I think it freaks the mainstream media out that he has this following of over 45-plus million people that follow him on social media, that he can have a direct conversation. He doesn't have to have it funnelled through the media,&amp;quot; Spicer said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trump's Twitter account, specifically, has more than 18 million followers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The future Press Secretary's remarks contrast with those of Trump himself in his first interview after winning the November 8 election, when he said that he would limit his use of Twitter and promised, instead of using it, to comport himself in a more prudent manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I'm going to be very restrained, if I use it at all, I'm going to be very restrained. I find it tremendous. It's a modern form of communication,&amp;quot; he said at the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the real-estate magnate has not appeared to curtail his tweets and in December remarked on the social network that the United States should &amp;quot;strengthen and expand&amp;quot; its nuclear capacity until &amp;quot;the world comes to its senses regarding nukes&amp;quot;, a comment that drew much criticism because of fears that such a course of action would spark a nuclear arms race.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also tweeted about the UN that &amp;quot;the United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time. So sad!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His UN comment came after the Security Council on December 23 decided to demand that Israel stop establishing settlements on Palestinian territory, a decision the US allowed by refusing to veto it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;lok/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Singapore, Jan 1 (IANS) The threat of breaching the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags that help automated identification of your mobile phone, passport, credit cards, access passes and others could soon be mitigated, thanks to the new security features researchers are developing.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To better safeguard the everyday technologies of RFID, researchers in Singapore are designing and testing new RFID protocols with enhanced security features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A security breach in RFID applications would leak valuable information about physical objects to unauthorised parties,&amp;quot; Li Yingjiu, Associate Professor at Singapore Management University said in an official statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many industries, like pharmaceutical companies, use the RFID technology to track inventory and manage supply chains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Because RFID tags work by broadcasting information to electronic RFID readers, security breaches can occur if hackers eavesdrop on this conversation, and manage to gain access to or tamper with information,&amp;quot; the study noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers say that such an attack, in the context of supply chain management, for example, would mean industrial espionage and the hacker may obtain sensitive information about inventory levels, trading volumes, trading partners and even business plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To tackle such a potential threat, researchers are employing strategies that include making the protocol's output unpredictable, making two tags indistinguishable to the hacker and preventing them from obtaining useful information even if they manage to interact with the tags.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In addition, there are many instances where sharing of RFID information -- between suppliers and retailers, for example, or between various components of an Internet of Things -- would have obvious benefits,&amp;quot; noted Li.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But without appropriate security controls, however, most companies would be reluctant to make valuable data readily available,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers are also designing improved access control mechanisms that protect RFID information when it is shared on the internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers said that one of the data security field's biggest challenges is the widening gap between academia and industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The future of data security, in my vision, is how to narrow the gap and bridge the two communities, which have completely different incentives and evaluation criteria,&amp;quot;  Li said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Li and his recently reported Android framework vulnerabilities and potential attacks to Google who acknowledged its findings in its security bulletins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, to give data owners a better control over who can access their data, the researchers are working to develop new solutions for attribute-based encryption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Jan 1 (IANS) A &amp;quot;fire to fight fire&amp;quot; treatment billed as a potential breakthrough in the fight against disease, including cancer, could back-fire and make the disease more damaging in some circumstances, a new research has found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It showed that introducing 'friendlier' less-potent strains into a bunch of disease-causing microbes can lead to increased disease severity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our study shows that a promising disease management strategy may not always be effective and indeed may have damaging unforeseen consequences,&amp;quot; said lead researcher Ivana Gudelj, Professor at Exeter University in Britain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research showed that far from being a &amp;quot;silver bullet&amp;quot; to weaken disease, the practice of introducing pacifist microbes into a host could make the aggressive pathogen stronger, which could hamper disease management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until now, introducing friendlier cousins, which do not cause severe disease, into a population of pathogens has been shown to reduce disease severity and damage to the infected host.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has been suggested that this approach could be an effective way of treating cancer, and research so far has proved effective and promising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, scientists have already produced encouraging results in the fight against Clostridium difficile infections that are so common in our hospitals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, the scientists tested this strategy using a plant pathogen, and found the therapy could go dramatically wrong, with devastating consequences for the host plant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team investigated the devastating rice blast disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They introduced a mixed population of the fungus that causes this disease into rice, where the mixture included an aggressive strain and a pacifist mutant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They expected that the overall disease severity would decrease because of the presence of the pacifist strain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, they found the opposite. The rice plants succumbed to much more severe disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, published in the journal eLife, showed that the therapy can in some circumstances have the opposite effect, and that the way the pathogen would behave can be unpredictable, leading to more severe disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research highlights the need for these new strategies to be carefully tested before they are used therapeutically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scientists used cooperation theory and mathematical modelling to identify the reason for their surprising result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They found that in some circumstances pacifists &amp;quot;helped&amp;quot; aggressive microbes to be more efficient in utilising resources obtained from the host.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We find that the mechanisms driving our unexpected findings when treating rice blast infection are pertinent for many diseases involving bacterial and fungal pathogens,&amp;quot;  Gudelj noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 1 (IANS) A gene mutation linked to Alzheimer's disease and other age-related cognitive declines in our relatively safe and sterile post-industrial setting might have actually helped protect us from cognitive decline in ancient times, a new research suggests.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings suggest that a genetic mutation (or allele) that puts populations at risk for illnesses in one environmental setting could manifest itself in positive ways in a different setting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It seems that some of the very genetic mutations that help us succeed in more hazardous time periods and environments may actually become mismatched in our relatively safe and sterile post-industrial lifestyles,&amp;quot; said lead author Ben Trumble, Assistant Professor at the Arizona State University in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a paper published in The FASEB Journal, the researchers examined how the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene might function differently in an infectious environment than in the urban industrialised settings where ApoE has mostly been examined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All ApoE proteins help mediate cholesterol metabolism, and assist in the crucial activity of transporting fatty acids to the brain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in industrialised societies, ApoE4 variant carriers also face up to a four-fold higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and other age-related cognitive declines, as well as a higher risk for cardiovascular disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goal of this study was to reexamine the potentially detrimental effects of the globally-present ApoE4 allele in environmental conditions more typical of those experienced throughout our species' existence -- in this case, a community of Amazonian forager-horticulturalists called the Tsimane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For 99 per cent of human evolution, we lived as hunter gatherers in small bands and the last 5,000-10,000 years -- with plant and animal domestication and sedentary urban industrial life -- is completely novel,&amp;quot; Trumble said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Due to the tropical environment and a lack of sanitation, running water, or electricity, remote populations like the Tsimane face high exposure to parasites and pathogens, which cause their own damage to cognitive abilities when untreated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, one might expect Tsimane ApoE4 carriers who also have a high parasite burden to experience faster and more severe mental decline in the presence of both these genetic and environmental risk factors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But researchers discovered the exact opposite when they tested these individuals using a seven-part cognitive assessment and a medical exam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, Tsimane who both carried ApoE4 and had a high parasitic burden displayed steadier or even improved cognitive function in the assessment versus non-carriers with a similar level of parasitic exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This indicated that the allele potentially played a role in maintaining cognitive function even when exposed to environmental-based health threats.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Seoul, Jan 1 (IANS/Yonhap) North Korea is in the final stages of preparing to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the country's leader said on Sunday in the latest sign that Pyongyang will not abandon its nuclear and missile programmes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We were actively engaged in research and development of advanced weapons... The develpoment of long-range missiles is in final stages,&amp;quot; Kim Jong-Un said in a televised New Year's message broadcast by the state-run TV station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His remarks come amid growing speculation that North Korea may carry out more powerful provocations around its key anniversaries this year as it pumps up efforts to make miniaturised and diversified nuclear weapons with the goal of developing a nuclear-tipped ICBM which can fly as far as the US mainland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim, in his speech, said that North Korea soared as a nuclear and military power boosted by the success of the country's two nuclear tests last year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The North Korean leader vowed to develop more weapons to boost its strike capabilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim also threatened that Pyongyang will beef up its readiness to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes if the United States and South Korea do not suspend their annual joint military exercises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;(If they do not stop nuclear threats), North Korea will keep increasing the military capabilities for self-defence and pre-emptive striking capacity with a main emphasis on nuclear force,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Pyongyang, the year 2017 is &amp;quot;an opportune time,&amp;quot; as it believes that Seoul and Washington will not be able to take physical or military actions to deter its nuclear aspirations due to their internal political situation, said Thae, a former top North Korean diplomat who defected to the South last July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Jan 1 (IANS) While many new entrants in the smartphone space make their debut in the sub-Rs 10,000 category to target the masses, domestic player Smartron is targeting the mid-range segment with its t.phone that comes with \&amp;quot;tron.x\&amp;quot; eco-system, enabling users access to various services from Smartron.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Built on the world of \&amp;quot;Internet of Trons\&amp;quot;, the tron.x eco-system allows instant access to your profile, data, content, services, Cloud, care, community and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices whether you are at home or in a car on the go or at office or in the field.

The tron.x eco-system offers t.cloud, t.store and t.care. Once enabled, t.cloud automatically backs up and allows you to access your data seamlessly from any Smartron device.

t.store offers an e-showcase of all Smartron device accessories, allowing you to get it delivered at your doorstep with a single click.

The company\'s 24/7 customer service, known as t.care, offers remote diagnostics and ensures you an uninterrupted experience.

Priced at Rs 24,999, the company has put high-end specifications into the phone and competes with the likes of the Chinese-made Xiaomi Mi 5 and OnePlus 3.

Here is what works for the device.

The t.phone sports a dual-tone colour scheme and comes in classic grey, metallic pink, steel blue and sunrise orange -- all of which look distinct. The review unit we received came in sunrise orange which looked a bit flashy.

The 5.5-inch, full-HD Super-AMOLED display with 401ppi produced vibrant images on the screen with good contrast and has good outdoor visibility.

Being a Super-AMOLED display, t.phone has higher colour gamut and images are vivid, clear and sharper than Xiaomi Mi 5, thus watching movies and videos is pleasant on the device.

The device is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor that was in the news for heating problems. However, we did not face any such issues during charging or while working on the device for longer hours.

The company has not customised the user interface and, running on Marshmallow, the t.phone delivers stock Android experience.

Although not the best camera in this price segment, t.phone captures decent quality images, but at times misses out details. The 16MP rear camera of the Xiaomi Mi 5 captured more colour and detailed shots than t.phone.

The speaker at the bottom with DTS premium and DTS PlayFi produces good sound. The smartphone incorporates four mics which will also help users who regularly listen to recordings for future use as the playback is clear. 

The 64GB onboard storage gives enough room to store your multimedia content. Coupled with t.cloud, the device offers unlimited storage; thus there will always be space for a precious moment without having the need to delete your data.

What does not work?

With a mid-range price tag, there is no fingerprint sensor when smartphones in the sub-Rs 10,000 range integrate one.

Conclusion: For a homegrown player and at Rs 24,999, the Smartron t.phone packs both style and substance and has specifications that performs well.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Jan 1 (IANS) Researchers have designed molecules with the potential to deliver healing power to stressed cells -- such as those involved in heart attacks.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research, at a cellular level in the laboratory, involves organic molecules that break down to release hydrogen sulphide when triggered by specific conditions such as increased oxidative stress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oxidative stress damages cells and is tied especially to heart disease and cancer as well as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We have discovered that small organic molecules can be engineered to release a molecule called carbonyl sulphide, which is the most prevalent sulphur-containing molecule in the atmosphere, but more importantly converts rapidly to hydrogen sulphide under biological conditions,&amp;quot; said study co-author Michael Pluth, Professor at the University of Oregon in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We developed and demonstrated a new mechanism to release small molecules that provide therapeutic hydrogen sulphide,&amp;quot; Pluth said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hydrogen sulphide, a colourless gas, has long been known for its dangerous toxicity -- and its telltale smell of rotten eggs -- in the environment, but it also is produced in mammals, including humans, with important roles in molecular signalling and cardiac health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the goals of developing these small hydrogen sulphide-releasing molecules is the potential for long-term applications in therapeutics, Pluth said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Separate portions of the research were detailed in the Journal of the American Chemical Society and in an international journal Angewandte Chemie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/py/&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Jammu, Dec 31 (IANS) To create a single source of readily available database for policy-making, evaluation and distribution of resources, the state education department on Saturday launched the internet-based School Management Information System (SMIS).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched by Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, the SMIS developed by the Education Department is an integrated technology framework that automates the entire end-to-end management of school education and its related information in the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SMIS is a digital initiative which includes both e-management of schools and e-learning of students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Education Minister Naeem Akhtar said here on Saturday that SMIS is a repository for data collection, processing, analysing and reporting of educational information including schools, students, teachers and staff of each and every school in the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It will provide administrators and teachers with the information required for informed planning, policy-making and evaluation. It will also empower the local communities to get involved in their children's education,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SMIS will be the largest e-governance initiative in J&amp;K with a huge base of stakeholders involving 33% of total employees of the state and around 26 lakh students,&amp;quot; the minister said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SMIS provides readily available digital details of all the 28,000 schools in the state, their location, type of school, number of classrooms, toilets, library, science labs, boundary wall, number of teachers, number of students, teacher-student ratio,&amp;quot; Akhtar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SMIS will help in scientific rationalisation of staff and space in schools, helping deployment of subject and qualification wise teachers. It also keep track of the academic performance of the schools, students, enrolment and dropout rate,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The minister said given its large school system spread across length and breadth of the state the absence of a reliable database had resulted in poor decision-making, lack of transparency and accountability, uneven infrastructure and non-reliable teacher and student records, which compromise the larger goal of quality education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sq/pgh/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 31 (IANS) The rapid rise in the atmospheres oxygen roughly 500 million years ago which made advanced animal life possible on Earth is linked to the process that led to the formation of fossil fuels, suggests new research.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rise in oxygen was associated with a rapid increase in the burial of sediment containing large amounts of carbon-rich organic matter - the raw material of coal, oil and natural gas, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Burying the sediments that became fossil fuels was the key to advanced animal life on Earth,&amp;quot; said study co-author Shanan Peters, Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Multicellular life is largely a creation of the &amp;quot;Cambrian explosion,&amp;quot; which coincided with a spike in atmospheric oxygen roughly 500 million years ago, Peters pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was during the Cambrian explosion that most of the animals appeared and evolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In green plants, photosynthesis separates carbon dioxide into molecular oxygen (which is released to the atmosphere), and carbon (which is stored in carbohydrates).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But photosynthesis had already been around for at least 2.5 billion years. So what accounted for the sudden spike in oxygen during the Cambrian?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published online in the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters, linked the rise in oxygen to a rapid increase in the burial of sediment containing large amounts of carbon-rich organic matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key is to recognise that sediment storage blocks the oxidation of carbon, Peters said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without burial, this oxidation reaction causes dead plant material on Earth's surface to burn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That causes the carbon it contains, which originated in the atmosphere, to bond with oxygen to form carbon dioxide. And for oxygen to build up in our atmosphere, plant organic matter must be protected from oxidation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And that is exactly what happens when organic matter -- the raw material of coal, oil and natural gas -- is buried through geologic processes, the researchers explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers warned that today, burning billions of tonnes of stored carbon in fossil fuels is removing large amounts of oxygen from the atmosphere, reversing the pattern that drove the rise in oxygen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so the oxygen level in the atmosphere falls as the concentration of carbon dioxide rises, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 31 (IANS) A family in the US who lost their young daughter in a car crash recently filed a lawsuit against Apple for allegedly encouraging distracted driving through &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; video calling app, media reported.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The family claims that Apple had the patent for a safer version of its &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; video calling app, but chose to make the less safe version available with the iPhone 6 -- ultimately leading to a car crash that resulted in the death of their five-year-old daughter Moriah Modisette, Courthouse News reported this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The case dates back to 2014 when Moriah was travelling in the back of her parents' car near Dallas and was hit by another car driven by Garrett Willhelm who was using the Apple &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; while driving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The erring driver had confessed to the police that he was on &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; and police had also found that the app was still live when they arrived at the scene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the fact that the app fully engages visual components, the Modisette family blamed Apple for its failure to either programme a shutoff into the &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; or give strong warning about using the app while driving.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Defendant Apple Inc. has had the technology to prevent these events, and the Modisettes' injuries, specifically since at least December 12, 2008, when it filed an application with the US Patent Office for a �driver handheld computing device lock-out,&amp;quot; the family said in the complaint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The failure of Apple to use GPS tracking to detect the speed of the vehicle in which a user was travelling and shut down the &amp;quot;FaceTime&amp;quot; app was a significant factor in the accident, the family added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The grieving family has sought economic damages along with punitive damages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Chennai, Dec 31 (IANS) The trial run of India's first 700 MW pressurised heavy water reactor (PHWR) coming up at Kakrapar is expected to take place sometime in mid-2017, said a senior official of the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL).&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India's atomic power plant operator NPCIL is building four 700 MW PHWRs -- two each at Kakrapar Atomic Power Station (KAPS) in Gujarat and Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) in Rajasthan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The construction of two 700 MW PHWRs at KAPS is at an advanced stage. The commissioning activities of the first unit has begun. The trial run of the first unit is expected to happen sometime during the middle of next year,&amp;quot; B.C.Pathak, Executive Director (Projects), told IANS here over phone from Mumbai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking to IANS, Vineet Kumar, Station Director of the two units (3 and 4 at KAPS) said: &amp;quot;We have started the commissioning activities. It will be done in stages and various milestones have to be crossed.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We will be doing the hydro test first in May-June 2017. The next step will be hot conditioning of the unit, which would happen around two-and-a-half months after the hydro test,&amp;quot; Kumar added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After that the systems have to be drained and dried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The fuel loading is expected to happen in October 2017 and the reactor's criticality (first time starting of the nuclear fission process) is slated to happen in November 2017,&amp;quot; Kumar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Kumar, the unit is expected to start commercial operations early 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As to the status of the other 700 MW unit Pathak said the 4th unit at KAPS would start 6-7 months after the third unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The project cost for the two 700 MW units is around Rs 11,500 crore, Kumar said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For NPCIL that has been building 220 MW and 540 MW pressurised heavy water reactors, it is a major jump to go in for 700 MW PHWRs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Concrete was first poured in November 2010 for the 3rd unit at KAPS and in March 2011 for the fourth unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Pathak work at the 7th and 8th units (700 MW) at RAPS are also progressing well with the erection of major components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two project sites are humming with activity and the project schedule is being compressed to complete it at the earliest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vj/ksk/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bengaluru, Dec 31 (IANS) Global headwinds such as macroeconomic factors, currency volatility and disruptive technologies impacted the resilient Indian IT industry in 2016, forcing Nasscom, its apex body, to lower the growth rate for fiscal 2016-17.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The IT industry is going through a transient phase with global and domestic factors impacting its performance. While the effect of short-term factors may show for a couple of quarters, the worst is behind us,&amp;quot; Nasscom President R. Chandrashekhar told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The single-digit growth of global software majors like TCS, Infosys, Wipro and HCL for the July-September second quarter made Nasscom revise its industry export revenue guidance to 8-10 per cent ($117-119 billion) in November from 10-12 per cent ($119-121 billion) it projected in February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) has, however, maintained the domestic revenue growth at 11-13 per cent to achieve Rs 1,560-1,590 billion ($22.9-23.4 billion) by March 31,2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This year has been an interesting one for the industry owing to various global and domestic factors. Increased adoption of digital technology by consumers, e-commerce and start-ups has driven the industry's growth in the domestic market,&amp;quot; Chandrashekhar asserted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though India accounts for 56 per cent of global sourcing with seven per cent market share of the world's software and IT services, currency volatility and innovative technologies like artificial intelligence, automation, Internet of Things and machining have disrupted the industry's traditional products and solutions to enterprises worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;To stay globally competitive, the industry needs to invest and enhance its digital capabilities. This entails a mix of reskilling, domain and platform capabilities coupled with acquisition-led competencies,&amp;quot; Chandrashekhar maintained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recovering from the fallout of the global financial meltdown in 2008-10, the Indian IT-BPM (Business Process Management) industry flourished to grow in double digits (12-14 per cent) on a wider base over the last couple of years, thanks to its adoption of cloud computing, big data, analytics and mobility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a result, the industry's revenue grew 12-13 per cent in the 2015-16 fiscal to $143 billion, including $108 billion from exports, while domestic revenue increased by 10 per cent to Rs 1,41,000 crore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time in many quarters, IT bellwether Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) reported flat sequential growth for the second quarter, which made its Chief Executive N. Chandrasekaran admit that growing uncertainties in the environment was creating caution among customers and resulted in holdbacks in discretionary spending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, Infosys lowered its annual revenue guidance to 8-9 per cent for this fiscal due to uncertain business outlook and currency volatility from 10-11.5 per cent on June 30 and 11.8-13.8 per cent it projected in April.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike its peers TCS and Infosys, Wipro projected flat revenue from its IT services for October-December third quarter due to weak demand and uncertainty in technology spend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government's push towards digitisation for a digital economy and enhancing the ease of doing business through administrative overhaul and tax reforms, however, augured well for the industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking forward, Chandrashekhar said 2017 would be the year of re-adoption for the industry, with technology disruptions reshaping enterprises and providers focusing on building technology-led platforms that can redefine services delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Trends like consumerisation of IT, SMAC (social, mobile, analytics and cloud), changing lines of business and new under-penetrated markets will alter the future of the industry.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industry hiring also took a beating, with the IT majors deferring recruitment of freshers from campuses, holding back appointments for laterals and postponing joining dates for new techies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The industry employee base reached 3.7 million, with an addition of 200,000 employees in 2015-16.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The industry is looking for talent from 'qualification' to 'skill-based' with greater focus on hiring 'knowledge and expertise'-based talent,&amp;quot; Chandrashekhar noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This is a part of a series of articles from IANS that look back at the year that was.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 31 (IANS) In a latest incident of censorship, Facebook on Friday temporarily restricted journalist Kevin Sessums's account, after he called US President-elect Donald Trump's supporters &amp;quot;a nasty fascistic lot&amp;quot; in a post.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Known for his two best-selling memoirs, Sessums said that he shared a Facebook post from ABC News' political analyst Matthew Dowd that read: &amp;quot;In the last few hours I have been called by lovely 'christian' Trump fans: a jew, faggot, retard. To set record straight: divorced Catholic.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sessums was later notified by Facebook that the post violated the company's &amp;quot;community standards&amp;quot; and was barred from posting for 24 hours. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was only after the Guardian contacted Facebook that they reviewed and restored the post of the journalist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are very sorry about this mistake,&amp;quot; the Guardian quoted a spokesman of Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The post was removed in error and restored as soon as we were able to investigate. Our team processes millions of reports each week, and we sometimes get things wrong,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is chilling. It is arbitrary censorship. I was like, 'Wait a minute, do I have to be careful about what I say about Trump now?'&amp;quot;  Sessums said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this year, Facebook banned a post that contained the 'Napalm Girl' photograph on the grounds that it reflected indecency and suspended the journalist who had posted it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accounts of Palestinian journalists were also briefly blocked, which the Facebook called an innocent mistake.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ksk&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 31 (IANS) To maintain accuracy, NASA said its missions, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, which continuously watches the sun, will join official clocks around the world in adding a leap second to the final minute of 2016.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On December 31, 2016, official clocks around the world will add a leap second at 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clocks do this to keep in sync with Earth's rotation, which gradually slows down over time. When the dinosaurs roamed Earth, for example, our globe took only 23 hours to make a complete rotation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In space, millisecond accuracy is crucial to understanding how satellites orbit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;SDO moves about 1.9 miles every second,&amp;quot; Dean Pesnell, project scientist for SDO at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So does every other object in orbit near SDO. We all have to use the same time to make sure our collision avoidance programs are accurate. So we all add a leap second to the end of 2016, delaying 2017 by one second,&amp;quot; Pesnell noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leap second is also key to making sure that SDO is in sync with the Coordinated Universal Time used to label each of its images. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Designed to help us understand the sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space, SDO was launched in 2010.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has a clock that counts the number of seconds since the beginning of the mission. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To convert that count to UTC requires knowing just how many leap seconds have been added to Earth-bound clocks since the mission started. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the spacecraft wants to provide a time in UTC, it calls a software module that takes into consideration both the mission's second count and the number of leap seconds -- and then returns a time in UTC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/ksk&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 30 (IANS) Despite the assumption that English is the lingua franca of global science, one-third of new conservation science documents published annually are in non-local languages and as a result some important scientific knowledge remains missing at the international level.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While we recognise the importance of a lingua franca and the contribution of English to science, the scientific community should not assume that all important information is published in English,&amp;quot; said Tatsuya Amano of the University of Cambridge, UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers conducted a survey of those in charge of Spain's protected natural areas and they found over half of the respondents identified language as an obstacle to using the latest science for habitat management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team surveyed web platform Google Scholar -- one of the largest public repositories of scientific documents -- in a total of 16 languages for studies relating to bio-diversity conservation published during a single year, 2014.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Of the over 75,000 documents, including journal articles, books and theses, some 35.6 per cent were not in English,&amp;quot; the study found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, also revealed that only half of non-English documents had titles or abstracts in English, thus making almost 13,000 scientific documents published in 2014 unsearchable using English keywords.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This can result in sweeps of current scientific knowledge -- known as 'systematic reviews' -- being biased towards evidence published in English,&amp;quot; researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This, in turn, may lead to over-representation of results considered positive or 'statistically significant', and these are more likely to appear in English language journals deemed 'high-impact',&amp;quot; they further added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some scholars at the University of Cambridge have developed a website &amp;quot;conservationevidence.com&amp;quot;, a repository for conservation science, and have also established an international panel to extract the best non-English language papers, including Portuguese, Spanish and Chinese.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers called for publishing basic summaries of a scientific study's key findings in multiple languages, and suggested that universities and funding bodies encourage translations as part of their 'outreach' evaluation criteria.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 30 (IANS) Praising the Aadhaar-based mobile payment application, BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money), which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, the industry stakeholders said it is a game-changer for cashless payments in India.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This will be a game changer for cashless payments in India. UPI (unified payment interface) is the most advanced payment system in the world. This will develop the overall payments ecosystem in the country,&amp;quot; said Rahul Gochhwal, co-founder Trupay, in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier in the day, Modi said BHIM app was very simple to use and a thumb impression was enough to operate it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Be it a smartphone or feature phone of Rs 1,000-1,200, BHIM app can be used. There is no need to have Internet connectivity. One only needs a thumb. There was a time when an illiterate was called 'angutha chhap'. Now, time has changed. Your thumb is your bank now. It has become your identity now,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This would be instrumental in further strengthening the digital payment system along with realising his dream of building a cashless economy,&amp;quot; said Bipin Preet Singh, founder and CEO of MobiKwik.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Going forward, we hope that provisions would be made for adding e-wallets on the Unified Payment Interface thereby enabling the people to pay through bank accounts or e-wallets using the BHIM app,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 30 (IANS) Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched an Aadhaar-based mobile payment application at 'DigiDhan Mela' here to promote and make digital transactions easier.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app is called BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) -- a re-branded version of UPI (Unified Payment Interface) and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the occasion, Modi said BHIM app was very simple to use and a thumb impression was enough to operate it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Modi said the government was working to launch a new security feature, by using which transactions could be carried out without a phone and Internet etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Be it a smartphone or feature phone of Rs 1,000-1,200, BHIM app can be used. There is no need to have Internet connectivity. One only needs a thumb. There was a time when an illiterate was called 'angutha chchap'. Now, time has changed. Your thumb is your bank now. It has become your identity now.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He dedicated the new app to Dr B.R. Ambedkar and said: &amp;quot;The mantra of Dr Ambedkar was to work for the uplift of the poor. And the biggest power of technology is that it can empower the poor.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking a dig at the Congress, Modi said during the earlier United Progressive Alliance rule at the Centre, money lost in the scams made news but now the nation is talking about money coming back into the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Look at the newspapers or video clips from three years ago -- the news was all about what we lost in scams. However, today, it is about what has come back or what is the gain,&amp;quot; Modi said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Prime Minister recalled the days when India was called 'sone ki chidiya' (bird of gold) and said the nation still had the potential to become the same again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said boosting digital connectivity will &amp;quot;do wonders for our nation&amp;quot;, adding that the day was not far off when the cash-based transaction will turn completely digital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Making a pitch for digital transactions, Modi said 'Lucky Grahak Yojana' and 'DigiDhan Vyapar Yojana' were a Christmas gift to the nation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 100 days, several prizes of Rs 1,000 will be given to people through lucky draws. The mega draw will be held on April 14, the birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar, he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;spk-vv/tsb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 30 (IANS) The e-commerce giant Amazon is considering flying warehouses called &amp;quot;airborne fulfilment centre (AFC)&amp;quot;, utilising drones for item delivery, according to media reports.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The AFC may be an airship that remains at a high altitude of 45,000 feet and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) with ordered items may be deployed from the AFC to deliver items to user designated delivery locations,&amp;quot; technology website theverge.com reported. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a patent filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office, shuttles (smaller airships) may be used to replenish the AFC with inventory, UAVs, supplies, fuel, etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Likewise, the shuttles may be utilised to transport workers to and from the AFC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leveraging aerial deployment, drones can serve a wider delivery range and owing to the mobile nature of the warehouses, it would allow Amazon greater flexibility in managing inventory when there is change in the demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the patent offers a hypothetical case of deploying an AFC near a sports stadium to allow for immediate delivery of team merchandise and snacks during a game, the report noted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new AFC concept could serve as a boon for logistics handling, but when it might happen is still unclear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 30 (IANS) In a study that has the potential to improve the safety and accuracy of CRISPR applications, researchers have discovered a way to switch off the revolutionary gene-editing system used in laboratories.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Researchers and the public are reasonably concerned about CRISPR being so powerful that it potentially gets put to dangerous uses,&amp;quot; said one of the researchers Joseph Bondy-Denomy from the University of California, San Francisco in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These inhibitors provide a mechanism to block nefarious or out-of-control CRISPR applications, making it safer to explore all the ways this technology can be used to help people,&amp;quot; Bondy-Denomy noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CRISPR-Cas9 has excited both researchers and the general public as a general use gene editing system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has the potential to enable scientists to quickly and efficiently modify genetic information and tweak gene activity in virtually any organism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many hope CRISPR will speed efforts to directly treat genetic disorders, among many other applications, but for the most part the technology has not yet proven quite precise enough, making occasional unintended edits along with the intended ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers and bioethicists also worry that the technology's very power and ease of use raise the possibility that it could potentially cause harm, either intentionally or by accident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The newly discovered anti-CRISPR proteins -- which are the first to work against the type of CRISPR-Cas9 system most commonly used by laboratories and the burgeoning gene editing industry -- could help resolve both problems, Bondy-Denomy said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To find such a switch, the researchers turned to the same billion-year arms race between viruses and bacteria that produced the CRISPR system itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Just as CRISPR technology was developed from the natural anti-viral defence systems in bacteria, we can also take advantage of the anti-CRISPR proteins that viruses have sculpted to get around those bacterial defences,&amp;quot; lead researcher Benjamin Rauch, a post-doctoral researcher in the laboratory of Bondy-Denomy, said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results published in the journal Cell suggest that proteins called &amp;quot;AcrIIA&amp;quot; are potent inhibitors of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system as it has been adopted in labs around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The next step is to show in human cells that using these inhibitors can actually improve the precision of gene editing by reducing off-target effects,&amp;quot; Rauch said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Moscow, Dec 30 (IANS) Recent Martian photographs taken by NASA's Curiosity rover have revealed purple rocks on the surface of the Red planet.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA officials have called this a suggestion to a greater degree of diversity in the geological composition of the region, and a hint as to what caused Mars to lose most of its water, Sputnik news agency reported on Friday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The photos were taken near the base of 18,000-foot Mount Sharp, one of Mars's tallest summits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Variations in colour of the rocks hint at the diversity of their composition on lower Mount Sharp,&amp;quot; NASA scientists said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Winds and windblown sand in this part of Curiosity's traverse and in this season tend to keep rocks relatively free of dust, which otherwise can cloak rocks' colour,&amp;quot; NASA said of the purple-hued rocks near the rover's late-2016 location on lower Mount Sharp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Curiosity has been exploring the slopes of the enormous mountain for over two years, sending photos back to NASA the entire time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US space agency stated that the purple coloration is caused by the presence of hematite, an iron oxide commonly used on Earth as a pigment, or jewellery component.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists studying Mars find the presence of hematite interesting, as it is typically formed in aqueous environment, suggesting that water may have once been present in the area. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Where water was, life may have had a chance to thrive as well� knowing just how the hematite on Mars was formed will help us characterise the past environment and determine whether that environment was favourable for life,&amp;quot; Joy Crisp from NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 30 (IANS) Giving more controls to the advertisers, Snapchat is using a recently rolled out machine learning technique -- goal-based bidding -- through which it determines the users who are most likely to engage with an advertisement on the app.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report on AdAge on Thursday, this type of bidding lets advertisers set goals on their campaigns beyond just views on ads and advertisers can bid on engagement with their ads when the desired outcome of the campaign is to have people swipe on the ads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Advertisers decide how much they value a swipe, and Snapchat automatically optimises bidding and delivery to a subset of the advertiser's target audience that has a propensity to swipe,&amp;quot; the report quoted a Snapchat spokesman as confirming in an e-mail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On an average, Snapchat's video ads get less than three seconds view time -- a matter of concern for the advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Around 20 per cent of advertisers are already using goal-based bidding and it has helped them achieve up to 40 per cent efficiencies in cost-per-swipe and increased ad view time,&amp;quot; Snapchat noted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This new option is available to advertisers through the Application Programming Interface.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 30 (IANS) To protect astronauts from the harsh Martian environment, the best building material for a new home on the Red Planet may lie in ice, say NASA researchers.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The surface of Mars has extreme temperatures and the atmosphere does not provide adequate protection from high-energy radiation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers believe that their &amp;quot;Ice Home&amp;quot; design provides a sound engineering solution to offer astronauts a safe place to call home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mars Ice Home is a large inflatable torus, a shape similar to an inner tube, that is surrounded by a shell of water ice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is just one of many potential concepts for sustainable habitation on the Red Planet in support of NASA's journey to Mars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;After a day dedicated to identifying needs, goals and constraints we rapidly assessed many crazy, out of the box ideas and finally converged on the current Ice Home design, which provides a sound engineering solution,&amp;quot; Kevin Vipavetz from NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Mars Ice Home design has several advantages that make it an appealing concept, according to the scientists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is lightweight and can be transported and deployed with simple robotics, then filled with water before the crew arrives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It incorporates materials extracted from Mars, and because water in the Ice Home could potentially be converted to rocket fuel for the Mars Ascent Vehicle, the structure itself doubles as a storage tank that can be refilled for the next crew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another critical benefit is that water, a hydrogen-rich material, is an excellent shielding material for galactic cosmic rays -- and many areas of Mars have abundant water ice just below the surface. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galactic cosmic rays are one of the biggest risks of long stays on Mars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This high-energy radiation can pass right through the skin, damaging cells or DNA along the way that can mean an increased risk for cancer later in life or, at its worst, acute radiation sickness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ice Home concept balances the need to provide protection from radiation, without the drawbacks of an underground habitat. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The design maximises the thickness of ice above the crew quarters to reduce radiation exposure while also still allowing light to pass through ice and surrounding materials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;All of the materials we've selected are translucent, so some outside daylight can pass through and make it feel like you're in a home and not a cave,&amp;quot; Kevin Kempton, part of the Langley team, said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA has set a goal of sending humans to the Red Planet in the 2030s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is important for astronauts to have something to look forward to when they arrive on the Red Planet, Kempton said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;After months of travel in space, when you first arrive at Mars and your new home is ready for you to move in, it will be a great day,&amp;quot; he noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 30 (IANS) Bringing more controls to the platform, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said that the company was thinking to bring editing functionality to tweets.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report on the Variety on Thursday, Dorsey made these remarks as part of an impromptu public town hall with Twitter users, asking them for feedback on how to improve the service. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a tweet on Thursday, Dorsey asked users what changes they wanted to be made in Twitter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Following the footsteps of Brian Chesky: what's the most important thing you want to see Twitter improve or create in 2017? #Twitter2017,&amp;quot; Dorsey tweeted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users made repeated requests to add edit function to the microblogging site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The request for an edit button for tweets came up multiple times, and Dorsey seemed to signal that the company is gearing towards a time-limited window to allow for the correction of typos right after a tweet was sent,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dorsey argued that allowing users to edit tweets they sent hours or days after the fact would lead to a more complicated solution, &amp;quot;including the need for a change log to give users the ability to review different versions of the same tweet.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter users also asked Dorsey to fight hate and harassment to which the CEO responded by saying that bringing transparency to Twitter was a &amp;quot;big priority&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/ksk&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 29 (IANS) Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said that his ministry is examining whether any changes in the IT Act are needed to &amp;quot;reinforce the security of digital transactions&amp;quot;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The minister also admitted that there are &amp;quot;challenges&amp;quot; in digital transactions but the government is &amp;quot;addressing&amp;quot; these. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are taking steps to boost digital transactions and make them more secure. In this connection I have asked the IT Secretary to see if the IT Act, 2000, needs certain reinforcements to take care of security needs of digital transactions,&amp;quot; Prasad said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I have told the secretary this must be examined and the report must come with follow up action within a fortnight,&amp;quot; he added.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On being asked about various hiccups, consumers encounter sometimes while making payments through their phones or cards - such as money is deducted but transaction is shown as failed - Prasad said there were indeed some issues but they were being sorted out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I admit there are challenges in digital transactions and we have to address them. For example, sometimes accidents occur on highways. But does it mean that highways should be closed,&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;mak/pgh/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 29 (IANS) Google is refusing to censor the rants of Al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who reportedly influenced the attackers who committed the 7/7 London bombings.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dubbed the &amp;quot;pied piper of Jihad,&amp;quot; al-Awlaki's hateful teachings were, according to RT online, easily searchable using Google's enhanced search function and are believed to have inspired jihadist terrorists and radicalised many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When users search al-Awlaki's name, Google's autocomplete function - which uses algorithms based on what others have searched before - suggests they view his &amp;quot;quotes&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;lectures,&amp;quot; a media report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An easily found downloadable PDF urges: &amp;quot;Martyrdom operations; we must refrain from calling it what the West labels it, �suicide bombings,' since suicide is haram in Islam; and shahada [martyrdom] is not suicide.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The top hit for &amp;quot;Anwar al-Awlaki quotes&amp;quot; was a website that includes comments from the preacher such as: &amp;quot;Jihad is still flourishing like a blessed tree sprouting through an earth of waste and pollution.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Al-Awlaki, who is an American and Yemeni imam who was implicated in the planning of several Al Qaeda attacks, lived in London for 18 months before moving to Yemen in 2004, where he was a leader of the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was killed in an American drone strike in 2011, but lives on in many YouTube videos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The prompting of these extra search terms has been described as &amp;quot;incredibly dangerous&amp;quot; by terrorism experts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Julie Shain of the Counter Extremism Project told the Times: &amp;quot;This incentivizes people to search for these things and suggests it's normal to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In combination with the thousands of videos and pages calling for attacks on the West, it's incredibly dangerous.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google recently changed its algorithms to prevent autocomplete suggesting anti-Semitic and misogynist searches. The company has also moved to prevent white supremacist and Holocaust denial websites from appearing in high or top results for certain searches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google's director, Matt Brittin, told Radio 4's Today programme the company works &amp;quot;very hard&amp;quot; to remove hateful and illegal content, but said autocomplete does save people time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's algorithmic, and I think people understand that these are suggestions based on what other people are searching for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So we can always improve that and we work hard to do that, but I think people are smart and they realize that not everything you find on the internet is accurate and there's a range of opinions there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A YouTube spokesman said: &amp;quot;YouTube has clear policies prohibiting content intending to incite violence and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged by our users.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ahm/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kathmandu, Dec 29 (IANS) The Nepali people will be able to use fourth generation (4G) telecommunication service for the first time from 2017 as Nepal Telecom, the state-owned telecom service provider, is starting the new service in two major cities from January 1.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nepali telecom companies till now provide only 2G and 3G services. In July this year, the Nepal government opened the doors for telecom companies to operate 4G service by amending the Radio Frequency Policy, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nepal Telecom (NT) is the first company to receive permission from the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), the regulatory body, to start the new service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are starting 4G service in Kathmandu and Pokhara, a tourist hub in western Nepal, from January 1, 2017&amp;quot; said Shovan Adhikari, joint spokesperson at NT.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We will expand the service in other areas of the country gradually.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 4G service is expected to help customers to operate the various services requiring high bandwidth such as video in an easier way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beside NT, three other telecom operators - Ncell, United Telecom Limited (UTL) and Smart Telecom, all privately owned, have also applied to NTA for approval to operate 4G service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Purusottam Khanal, spokesperson of NTA said that they were studying the roll out plans of the private sector telecom operators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are currently six telecom operators in Nepal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;soni/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 29 (IANS) IIT-Kharagpur researchers have created a model to explain how liquids spread through paper, a finding that can aid in the design and development of low-cost, paper-based diagnostics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some such products could be pregnancy test strips, alkalinity or acidity test strips of beauty and baby soaps, paper-strips for checking water quality and medical diagnosis aided by paper-strip tests of urine, saliva and blood. The model can also improve the functions of writing, drawing and painting using pen and paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This technique follows the same physical law of diffusion which explains how we write on paper with an ink pen, said researchers at the institute's Department of Mechanical Engineering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Liquid spreading in a paper is essentially random liquid motion through a randomly distributed network of fibers,&amp;quot; said Suman Chakraborty, lead researcher of the investigation at the IIT-Kgp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite wide use of liquid-infused paper technologies, there are gaps in the understanding of the basic science behind its behaviour. Chakraborty and his students, Kaustav Chaudhury and Shantimoy Kar, help fill that gap by observing ink spreading on filter paper using an electron microscope scanner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By understanding liquid spread in the paradigm of diffusion, scientists can control it more precisely to create and refine new products that involve liquid spreading through paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results are published in Applied Physics Letters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

Chandrababu Naidu, after a three-month pilot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ericsson earlier this year signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Andhra Pradesh government and the University of California - Berkley to help improve lives of farmers in and around Mori.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The 'Connected Aquaponics' and 'Smart Water Grid Management' IoT solutions being demonstrated here will help improve harvest and optimise water distribution. It has the potential to provide an improved life for millions of farmers in the country,&amp;quot; said Anand Varadarajan, head of Ericsson Research, Chennai, at Ericsson India, in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Connected Aquaponics integrates aquaculture and hydroponics for reuse of the ammonia-rich waste water from aquaculture for organic farming and recycle the water back to the aqua farm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Using wireless sensor network and Ericsson's AppIOT platform, we enable the monitoring of the aqua farm 24x7, thereby enabling the farmers with real-time information,&amp;quot; the company said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This enables the farmers to increase the yield as well as bring down the production cost with optimum use of the raw materials and repeated use of water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 'Smart Water Grid Management' solution has been designed to enable efficient use of natural water resources in the Godavari basin through use of sensors and actuators. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The sensors measure the quality of water, flow of water and level in the water storage tanks across the village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/nir/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 29 (IANS) Facebook already knows a lot about your online activities and you are pretty much aware of it. But a new media investigation has revealed that the social networking giant buys data on your offline activities without your knowledge.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The information that Facebook collects can include things like how much money you make, the stores you shop in, and even the number of credit cards you own, according to the  investigation by ProPublica.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of the issue is that the tech giant gives users little indication that it buys far more sensitive data about them than what the social media platform declares it knows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook uses algorithms to categorise its users in tens of thousands of micro-targetable groups for advertisers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Facebook's site says it gets information about its users 'from a few different sources',&amp;quot; ProPublica said in its report on Tuesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;What the page doesn't say is that those sources include detailed dossiers obtained from commercial data brokers about users' offline lives. Nor does Facebook show users any of the often remarkably detailed information it gets from those brokers,&amp;quot; it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;They are not being honest,&amp;quot; Jeffrey Chester, Executive Director of the Center for Digital Democracy, was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Facebook is bundling a dozen different data companies to target an individual customer, and an individual should have access to that bundle as well,&amp;quot; Chester noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Ottawa, Dec 29 (IANS) A NASA satellite has captured a dazzling infrared image of northern lights that appeared as swirls of glowing clouds over northern Canada on the night of December 22.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a statement, NASA's Earth Observatory said that the night after the winter solstice, NASA's Suomi NPP spacecraft recorded the northern lights, or aurora borealis, across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nunavut and northwest territories in Canada.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The collision of solar particles and pressure on our planet's magnetosphere accelerates particles trapped in the space around Earth. Those particles are sent crashing down into Earth's upper atmosphere -- at altitudes of 100 to 400 km -- where they excite oxygen and nitrogen molecules and release photons of light. The results are rays, sheets and curtains of dancing light in the sky,&amp;quot; NASA said in a statement explaining the northern lights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The solar storms that create the stunning manifestation of the northern lights occur roughly every 11 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The last cycle peak occurred in 2013, though NASA researchers reported that solar maximum was the weakest observed in a century,&amp;quot; the report noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in Live Science on Wednesday, the satellite's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite captured the northern lights display from 824 km above the Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sana/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

I feel that the ONLY thing I have to live for is this little guy asleep in my arms right now, John. He is the only reason why I haven't blown my head off right now.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chilling Facebook post further added, &amp;quot;And even now all I can think about is leaving this world. Putting a gun in my mouth and leaving. Which is what is about to happen.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shermeyer's post reflected her love for the child and the challenges she has faced as a single parent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apparently addressing to her husband, Shermeyer wrote in her post, &amp;quot;You will never see your son again. You don't deserve to have a son, a legacy. Why should you have your name carried on? You are a nasty man.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Police was investigating the death of Shermeyer as a case of suicide and her toddler's as a homicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/in/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 29 (IANS) The holiday season was a big hit for Apple's iPhone, as Yahoo-owned research firm Flurry revealed that during the critical shopping period between December 19 to 25, Apple's iPhone and iPad accounted for 44 per cent of all mobile activations -- much higher than Samsung.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research firm also revealed that Samsung saw its many devices combine to account for 21 per cent of all activations during the period, while Huawei was in third place with three per cent market share, followed by several other manufacturers, including LG and Amazon, at two per cent share each.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report in the Fortune on Thursday, Apple appears to be the single leader during the last week of holiday shopping as the data shared by the Flurry gives a picture from December 19 only, therefore not offering any clear idea about the rest of the holiday shopping season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, Apple's devices accounted for 49.1 per cent of all activations during the same period while Samsung last year accounted for 19.8 per cent of all activations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Part of Apple's troubles in 2016 might have been a shift in how consumers are spending money on new mobile devices. Between December 19 and 25, full-size tablets like the iPad Pro or iPad Air 2 only accounted for 9 per cent of all mobile device purchases. In 2013, their share of sales stood at 17 per cent,&amp;quot; the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Phablets continue to increase their holiday share, at the detriment of the medium phone. Tablet device activations have stabilised and are relatively flat year over year. This indicates that users find purpose for their purchase, albeit the devices cater to more niche use,&amp;quot; the research firm noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Flurry, Google could not crack into the list of top mobile device manufacturers this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 29 (IANS) For welcoming the New Year, you will have to wait a little longer than usual as timekeepers will add a &amp;quot;leap second&amp;quot; to the final minute of 2016.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On December 31, 2016, a &amp;quot;leap second&amp;quot; will be added to the world's clocks at 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the US Naval Observatory said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UTC is computed in Paris, France, at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, time was based on the mean rotation of the Earth relative to celestial bodies and the second was defined in this reference frame. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the invention of atomic clocks defined a much more precise &amp;quot;atomic&amp;quot; timescale and a second that is independent of Earth's rotation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Measurements show that the Earth, on average, runs slow compared to atomic time, at about 1.5 to 2 milliseconds per day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists have determined that after roughly 500 to 750 days, the difference between Earth rotation time and atomic time would be about one second.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the organisation which monitors the difference in the two time scales and calls for leap seconds to be inserted in or removed from UTC when necessary to keep them within 0.9 seconds of each other. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the system was instituted in 1972, the difference between International Atomic Time  and UTC was determined to be 10 seconds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 1972, 26 additional leap seconds have been added at intervals varying from six months to seven years. The most recent was inserted on June 30, 2015. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 29 (IANS) Astronauts on the International Space Station are to conduct two spacewalks in January for a \&amp;quot;complex\&amp;quot; upgrade to the orbital outpost\'s power system, US space agency NASA said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spacewalks will allow the crew members to install adapter plates and hook up electrical connections for six new lithium-ion batteries delivered to the orbital laboratory early this month, NASA said on Wednesday.

Shane Kimbrough and Flight Engineer Peggy Whitson of NASA will perform the first spacewalk on January 6, while the work for the second spacewalk on January 13 will be conducted by Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency, Xinhua news reports.

According to NASA, prior to each spacewalk, the new batteries will be robotically extracted from a pallet to replace 12 older nickel-hydrogen batteries through a series of robotic operations.

Nine of the older batteries will be stowed in a cargo resupply craft for later disposal, while three will remain on the station\'s truss, disconnected from the power grid, it said.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata/Bengaluru, Dec 28 (IANS) The increasing use of digital technologies in buying and selling merchandise for convenience and mobility pushed e-commerce in India to an inflection point in 2016.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rapid growth of smartphones and internet connectivity across the country, especially in tier-II and III cities, has given greater access to virtual shopping and e-tailing for the tech-savvy generation and millennials.

Even as e-tail behemoths Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon vied for a greater pie of the growing e-commerce market, enterprises and businesses in diverse sectors have joined the bandwagon to hard-sell their products by leveraging digital technology.

\&amp;quot;E-commerce in India is at an inflection point, thanks to robust growth in consumer demand. Mobile penetration and increasing use of smart phones have led to the emergence of m-commerce, which accounted for about 40 per cent of the sector\'s sales this year,\&amp;quot; Tata CLiQ Chief Executive Officer Ashutosh Pandey told IANS.

According to a study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), transition to mobile shopping is faster in India, which overtook the US this year in terms of active mobile users (220 million) and next only to China in user base.

The emergence of the Omni-channel model in e-tailing has also enabled netizens shop across e-portals, web sites, apps and in stores as per their convenience.

\&amp;quot;As a result, e-commerce players are looking at seamless integration of online and offline stores to offer consumers a unique shopping experience in the virtual and real worlds,\&amp;quot; Pandey asserted.

With digital payments increasing through multiple gateways for online and offline buying, the push for cashless transactions in the aftermath of the November 8 demonetisation has driven more and more consumers to e-shopping and m-shopping.

Greater use of cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence has made e-commerce players not only competitive and smart in retaining their mass user-base but also map shopping trends and predict purchasing patterns to consolidate their dominant position for sustaining growth.

\&amp;quot;The sector, however, continues to face a trust-deficit and last-mile delivery issues persist despite having robust logistics networks and partners. Lack of trust in online transactions makes many shoppers prefer cash on delivery, which is risky and time consuming,\&amp;quot; Pandey lamented.

The sector is also bedevilled by infrastructure woes across cities and towns, increasing operational cost for timely delivery and expanding the customer base.

Though demonetisation has impacted the retail sector due to the cash crunch, digital transactions have enabled e-commerce firms to weather the crisis.

Growing at about 40 per cent cumulative average growth rate (CAGR), the country\'s e-commerce market is projected to touch a whopping $38 billion this fiscal (2016-17), with the online travel segment alone accounting for 70 per cent, followed by e-tailing, financial services, classifieds, job searches and matrimony.

\&amp;quot;The key drivers of the sector\'s growth have been increased internet penetration, growing acceptability of online payments and an increase in per capita income,\&amp;quot; a Snapdeal spokesperson said.

Favourable government policies and improving infrastructure have also contributed in connecting consumers and sellers across the country.

\&amp;quot;The start-up ecosystem has gone through a phase of consolidation, indicating maturity in the sector for achieving scale, building capabilities and increasing the market share,\&amp;quot; the spokesperson explained.

Given the demographics and rapid adoption of the internet, it\'s advantage for all the stakeholders to grow and consolidate.

Global audit firm KMPG\'s e-commerce partner Sreedhar Prasad said demonetisation had impacted the sector with a 30 per cent dip in sales and, as a result, the annual growth may not show a big spike.

\&amp;quot;The cost of business, including that of supply chains, remains a challenge. Unless the cost is regulated, profitability will be difficult in the sector,\&amp;quot; Prasad added.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Dec 28 (IANS) China is aiming to own the race for space in the next decade, the country's space agency has said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China's ambitious and fast-growing space programme is targeting a landing on the dark side of the moon by 2018, and reaching Mars before the end of the decade, CNN reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The country's space agency on Tuesday released a policy paper, and outlined the government's goals for exploring deep space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wu Yanhua, deputy chief of the National Space Administration, said Beijing aims to launch its first Mars probe around 2020 to carry out orbiting and roving exploration, followed by a second mission that would include collection of surface samples from the red planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wu said China's other plans include sending probes to Jupiter and its moons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Our overall goal is that, by around 2030, China will be among the major space powers of the world,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;China was late to the space race -- it did not send its first satellite into space until 1970, just after the US put the first man on the moon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But in the decades since, China has pumped billions of dollars and other resources into research and training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 2003, China has staged a spacewalk, landed a rover on the moon and launched a space lab that it hopes paves the way for a 20-ton space station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has also sent five crews into space in the same span of time, making it only the third country in the world -- after Russia and the US -- to have such success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wu said China was still studying the possibility of sending a man to the moon, but focusing on robotic lunar missions for now, including making the first soft landing on the far side of the moon around 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also emphasised on China's increasing cooperation with other space agencies -- with NASA being the exception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since 2011, the US Congress has prohibited NASA from working with China because of national security concerns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During his campaign, US President-elect Donald Trump professed his love for NASA and that &amp;quot;space is terrific&amp;quot;. His senior advisors have advocated a &amp;quot;new vision&amp;quot; for the US space programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;NASA should be focused primarily on deep space activities rather than Earth-centric work that is better handled by other agencies,&amp;quot; wrote Robert Walker and Peter Navarro in October.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While the American government's space programme has suffered from under-investment, both China and Russia continue to move briskly forward with military-focused initiatives,&amp;quot; they added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Each continues to develop weapons explicitly designed... to 'deny, degrade, deceive, disrupt, or destroy' America's eyes and ears in space.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chinese officials on Tuesday reiterated the country's &amp;quot;peaceful motives&amp;quot; behind its space exploration and utilisation, but many have pointed to Walker and Navarro's article as a sign that potential US-China collaboration in space would be unlikely -- and probably even more so after Trump's recent tweets challenging Beijing's polices on issues ranging from Taiwan to trade and South China Sea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;py/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 28 (IANS) A draft proposal for accepting new members into the Nuclear Suppliers Group paves the way for India's entry but leaves Pakistan out, says a US-based arms control organisation.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Arms Control Association (ACA), Washington, also warns that relaxing membership rules will undermine non-proliferation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last week, the US media reported that Rafael Mariano Grossi, a former chairman of the NSG, had prepared a two-page document, explaining how a non-NPT state, like India and Pakistan, could join the group. Grossi was acting on behalf of the current chairman, Song Young-wan of South Korea, and his document enjoys a semi-official status, Dawn reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To prevent India from blocking Pakistan from joining the NPT, Grossi's draft note proposes that &amp;quot;one non-NPT member state should reach an understanding not to block consensus on membership for another non-NPT member state&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But ACA's Executive Director Daryl Kimball warns that &amp;quot;Pakistan still has grounds to object to the formula outlined by Grossi&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He explains that the document will require Pakistan to meet the same criteria for membership as India &amp;quot;but, to engage in civil nuclear trade with NSG states, it would have to win a separate NSG exemption from the full-scope safeguards requirement&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India is seeking membership of the NSG on the strength of the fact that it is already doing business with NSG members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 48-nation NSG is a nuclear technology control organisation formed in 1975 in response to India's first nuclear weapons test, which used plutonium produced with nuclear technology from Canada and the US. The NSG seeks to prevent similar future misuses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Current NSG membership rules require a state to sign the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) before joining this exclusive club. India remains one of only three countries, with Israel and Pakistan, never to have signed the NPT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier this year, India formally applied for membership and was followed by Pakistan. The US, and a host of other powerful western nations, back India's application, but China and half a dozen other nations are blocking India's membership, which requires a consensus of all members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India hoped to join the group during NSG's last plenary session, held in Seoul in June this year, but the meeting ended without taking any decision on New Delhi's application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ahm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Giving its digital economy drive a shot in the arm, the government through its outreach campaign 'DigiDhan Abhiyan' has enrolled over 1 crore rural citizens for digital methods of payment since its launch earlier this month, an official statement said here on Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 3 lakh merchants have started offering digital payment options to rural customers across many districts and blocks in rural India, the statement said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The rapid pace at which rural citizens are adopting digital methods of payment demonstrates their support and enthusiasm to be a part of the digital transformation story of our country. It is very encouraging to see our Prime Minister's dream of honest and transparent digital governance turn into reality,&amp;quot; said Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Electronics &amp;amp; Information Technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On November 8, the Modi government demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes across the country. Since then the government has been planning to convert the country's economy into a more digital one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have recorded the highest number of enrolments with citizen enrolment crossing 15 lakh and 12.5 lakh respectively, the statement said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh have recorded the highest number of merchant enrolments crossing 60,000 merchants each, it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The common service centres (CSC) and the village-level entrepreneurs have reached out to citizens innovatively to impart digital literacy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The DigiDhan Abhiyan aims to cover 2 lakh CSC across the rural areas and enable them to become Digital Financial Education centres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The CSCs will train people about the various digital financial solutions and also enable them to use various modes of electronic payment systems (EPS). The campaign also aims to sensitise merchants and vendors on the use of EPS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The DigiDhan Abhiyan outreach in rural India through the common service centres reflects citizen's willingness to go digital and the acceptance of new methods of digital transactions which are convenient and easy to access or use,&amp;quot; said Aruna Sundararajan, Secretary, Ministry of Electronics &amp;amp; Information Technology (MeitY).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We will continue to leverage newer technologies to build smart digital tools for easy use to enable this massive digital transformation,&amp;quot; she added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/lok/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) As digital payments go up post-demonetisation, the country needs separate digital payment laws and digital payment courts should be established across India along with an appropriate legal framework, the CMAI Association of India (CMAI) said on Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;All cases of money lost in digital payments may not fall in the category of cyber thefts or breaches. With proliferation of digital payments across India in big and small towns, there may be widespread cases of small amounts here and there throughout the country. There is also need for legal framework for data storage and data protection,&amp;quot; said NK Goyal, President CMAI, during an event here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The telecom industry body also urged the government to promote domestic manufacturing of Point of Sale (PoS) machines and its software development under the &amp;quot;Make in India&amp;quot; initiative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital payments have gone up 300 per cent since demonetisation, creating a need to add 20 lakh more PoS machines to the existing 15 lakh machines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When millions of people are joining digital payments movement daily, safety of data remains paramount which can be ensured only by pushing indigenous manufacturing of PoS machines. We cannot depend on foreign manufacturers if we want to make our economy cashless and all digital economy should also add to Make in India,&amp;quot; Goyal explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Majority of PoS machines are currently imported primarily from the US, Europe and China and, therefore, data security remains a big challenge,&amp;quot; Goyal added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;CMAI also suggested mandatory cyber audit by Reserve Bank of India or Cyber Command Group at regular intervals.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The telecom industry body called for an appropriate and robust mechanism to report losses and recovery of money lost, theft or frauds in digital payments and requested for an institutionalised policy for redressal of complaints of citizens with regard to digital payments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the CMAI, an immediate action plan for the projected five lakh cyber experts was needed as per the cyber policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

The social platform then searches to see if users in the area are discussing the incident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If enough users are referencing the incident, those in the area are invited to mark themselves as safe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Facebook, the title of the safety check is taken from the alert provided by the third-party source.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;py/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata/Bengaluru, Dec 28 (IANS) The increasing use of digital technologies in buying and selling merchandise for convenience and mobility pushed e-commerce in India to an inflection point in 2016.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rapid growth of smartphones and internet connectivity across the country, especially in tier-II and III cities, has given greater access to virtual shopping and e-tailing for the tech-savvy generation and millennials.

Even as e-tail behemoths Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon vied for a greater pie of the growing e-commerce market, enterprises and businesses in diverse sectors have joined the bandwagon to hard-sell their products by leveraging digital technology.

\&amp;quot;E-commerce in India is at an inflection point, thanks to robust growth in consumer demand. Mobile penetration and increasing use of smart phones have led to the emergence of m-commerce, which accounted for about 40 per cent of the sector\'s sales this year,\&amp;quot; Tata CLiQ Chief Executive Ashutosh Pandey told IANS.

According to a study by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), transition to mobile shopping is faster in India, which overtook the US this year in terms of active mobile users (220 million) and next only to China in user base.

The emergence of the Omni-channel model in e-tailing has also enabled netizens shop across e-portals, web sites, apps and in stores as per their convenience.

\&amp;quot;As a result, e-commerce players are looking at seamless integration of online and offline stores to offer consumers a unique shopping experience in the virtual and real worlds,\&amp;quot; Pandey asserted.

With digital payments increasing through multiple gateways for online and offline buying, the push for cashless transactions in the aftermath of the November 8 demonetisation has driven more and more consumers to e-shopping and m-shopping.

Greater use of cloud computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence has made e-commerce players not only competitive and smart in retaining their mass user-base but also map shopping trends and predict purchasing patterns to consolidate their dominant position for sustaining growth.

\&amp;quot;The sector, however, continues to face a trust-deficit and last-mile delivery issues persist despite having robust logistics networks and partners. Lack of trust in online transactions makes many shoppers prefer cash on delivery, which is risky and time consuming,\&amp;quot; Pandey lamented.

The sector is also bedevilled by infrastructure woes across cities and towns, increasing operational cost for timely delivery and expanding the customer base.

Though demonetisation has impacted the retail sector due to the cash crunch, digital transactions have enabled e-commerce firms to weather the crisis.

Growing at about 40 per cent cumulative average growth rate (CAGR), the country\'s e-commerce market is projected to touch a whopping $38 billion this fiscal (2016-17), with the online travel segment alone accounting for 70 per cent, followed by e-tailing, financial services, classifieds, job searches and matrimony.

\&amp;quot;The key drivers of the sector\'s growth have been increased internet penetration, growing acceptability of online payments and an increase in per capita income,\&amp;quot; a Snapdeal spokesperson said.

Favourable government policies and improving infrastructure have also contributed in connecting consumers and sellers across the country.

\&amp;quot;The start-up ecosystem has gone through a phase of consolidation, indicating maturity in the sector for achieving scale, building capabilities and increasing the market share,\&amp;quot; the spokesperson explained.

Given the demographics and rapid adoption of the internet, it\'s advantage for all the stakeholders to grow and consolidate.

Global audit firm KMPG\'s e-commerce partner Sreedhar Prasad said demonetisation had impacted the sector with a 30 per cent dip in sales and, as a result, the annual growth may not show a big spike.

\&amp;quot;The cost of business, including that of supply chains, remains a challenge. Unless the cost is regulated, profitability will be difficult in the sector,\&amp;quot; Prasad added.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Amid the steady 4G adoption growth, 53 per cent of Indians bought their smartphones online while 39 per cent of smartphone owners still preferred retail stores to buy a new device in 2016, a Deloitte survey revealed on Wednesday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the 'Mobile Consumer Survey 2016', 4G adoption is expected to grow strongly over the next year to become the predominant data network and about 45 per cent of the respondents said that they would subscribe to 4G or LTE in the next 12 months.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;With internet becoming cheaper and higher mobile data penetration, consumers are becoming extremely data hungry. Thus, usage of smartphone is only expected to grow from here onwards,&amp;quot; said Neeraj Jain, Partner, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP, in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Communication services namely social networks and instant messaging are the two things consumers check on their smartphones first thing in the morning, the findings showed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings showed that smartphone users wield their devices to check bank balances (54 per cent), pay utility bills (54 per cent) and services bill (53 per cent) the most. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is followed by transferring money within the country (38 per cent) and abroad (31 per cent). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The most common reason given for not using phone to make a payment was fear about security, cited by 29 per cent of respondents,&amp;quot; the survey noted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The survey analysed the mobile usage habits of over 2,000 Indian consumers as part of a global survey of 53,000 respondents across five continents and 31 countries. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The India data comprised of representatives from eight urban cities with internet access and adults aged between 18 and 54.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 28 (IANS) Did you know your iPhone photo app has the potential to search photos and tag both people and objects? If your phone runs on iOS 10, it definitely can.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app conducts the search locally, rather than using the Cloud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Both Google and Apple's services use 'computer vision' to detect what's in photos. But on the iPhone it's incredibly easy to pick a subject, let's say 'cats' and search your photo library for images that feature a cat,&amp;quot; Fortune reported on Wednesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To save you on battery, iOS only does this when the phone is charging. Whenever you capture a new image, Apple's Image Signal Processor is able to detect objects and people, and will then look them up against its inbuilt database. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To try this hidden feature, open the Photos app and tap on the search magnifying glass.  Users can tell Apple Photos who appears in your images and it should then be able to look and identify those people again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/gb/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<description><![CDATA[ New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Taking smartphone photography to the next level, Chinese manufacturer nubia has introduced its \"bezel-less\" flagship Z11 that features NeoVision 6.0 -- a DSLR-like photography system.]]></description>
<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Taking smartphone photography to the next level, Chinese manufacturer nubia has introduced its \&amp;quot;bezel-less\&amp;quot; flagship Z11 that features NeoVision 6.0 -- a DSLR-like photography system.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Competing in the mid-range segment, the Rs 29,999 nubia Z11 takes the OnePlus 3, OnePlus 3T and Xiaomi Mi 5 devices head on.

Here is what works for the Z11:

The black and gold finish phone has a unique design which is surely a head-turner. Featuring a rectangular-shape metal uni-body construction, the device feels sturdy in the hand. Adopting an aircraft-grade aluminium alloy, the Z11 is also corrosion-resistant and anti-oxidative.

If you have seen nubia devices before, you will be aware of the red rings the company uses around the camera and at front to make the phone stand out in the crowd.

The rounded, contoured corners around the sides and back make it easy to hold with one hand. Apart from zero bezel display, another highlight of the device is the 16MP rear-facing camera with a Sony IMX298 sensor.

We were delighted by the camera\'s performance. The shutter speed is good and the images captured were detailed with enough colour and without any hint of oversaturation. The shots not only looked brilliant on the device but also on bigger screens. No doubt the camera performance is better than its nearest rivals.

Integrating OIS (Optical Image Stabiliser), nubia HIS (Hand-Held Image Stabilisation) and EIS (Electronic Image Stabiliser) features, the camera captured stable shots while in motion with zero shakes.

The filters on the camera app, specially \'Mucha\' and \'Sketch,\' worked really well, giving an artistic view of the subject being captured.

The shots taken in low-lit environments also had a decent amount of detail, without any hint of noise.

Another interesting feature that the smartphone packs for multi-tasking is the split-screen. Swipe down from the bottom of the display and nubia Z11 splits the screen into two separate home screens allowing you to use two apps simultaneously.

The split-screen worked fine while using social media apps, web browsing and you can use any application in both the screens -- except the camera.

Harnessing power from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor with 6GB of RAM, the device running on nubia UI 4.0 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow worked smoothly with apps being loaded quickly.

Apart from the \&amp;quot;bezel-less\&amp;quot; design, the company has also packed some tricks into its UI to make the edges more interactive.

For example, swiping repeatedly from the edges clears background apps and frees up space. Swiping on both edges adjusts brightness. We also liked the fun animations on the screen while performing edge gestures.

What does not work?

There is no app drawer. Other than that, we did not find any problem with the device.

Conclusion: A brilliant 5.5-inch smartphone, Z11 excelled in every aspect, delivering snappy performance. The camera was the show-stopper. So if you want a mini-DSLR in your pocket, Z11 is your choice.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 27 (IANS) Eco-friendly antimicrobial agents that are being developed by a team of researchers at New Zealand's University of Auckland could contribute in some of the key identified sectors in 'Make in India', says an Indian-origin member of the scientific team.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists associated with the Biocide ToolBox (BTB) programme are targeting the discovery and invention of eco-friendly biocides - chemical agents which control or kill bacteria - to design a range of products and solutions like antifouling coatings and food packaging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The programme, funded by the nation's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), is a major antimicrobial research programme hosted by the University of Auckland and closely networked with the University of Otago, Scion and the Cawthorn Institute in New Zealand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The initiatives taken in BTB programme could contribute in some of the key identified sectors in 'Make in India' , for example, chemicals, biotechnology, food processing, smart textiles. Joint R&amp;D partnership between BTB and corporates in India could enhance the scope of developing customised biocidal products particularly important for Indian market and possible manufacturing of some of these products in India,&amp;quot; Sudip Ray, a senior research fellow in the School of Chemical Sciences with the MBIE Biocide Toolbox and Product Accelerator Programmes at University of Auckland, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTB aims at the development of a toolbox of new greener biocides applicable in commercial and healthcare contexts which contribute to NZ export growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ray was in Kolkata for a series of lectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Describing the initiative, he said the current research is focused on developing a suite of biocides which constitute practical solutions for a range of products like decorative paints, antifouling coatings, food packaging, cleaning chemicals, air conditioning tunnelling/filters, medical equipment, in various healthcare settings requiring a safe and clean environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These biocides developed by BTB in New Zealand could be exported in India as chemicals and then incorporated in products which utilise biocides and thereby the final manufacturing of the biocidal products could be performed in India. This will fulfil the key focus of aMake in India' and also enhance the possibility of exports from New Zealand,&amp;quot; he explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the innovations is turning wine waste into biodegradable plastics with usable anti-bacterial properties for use in food packaging and storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently India and New Zealand discussed the promotion of FDI in India in support of India's Make in India campaign and development objectives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So, R&amp;D partnership could further strengthen the growing bilateral relationship between India and New Zealand,&amp;quot; Ray added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/vd&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 27 (IANS) Researchers have created a novel material out of silk protein that can be preprogrammed with biological, chemical, or optical functions, such as mechanical components that change colour with strain, deliver drugs, or respond to light.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using a water-based fabrication method based on protein self-assembly, the researchers generated three-dimensional bulk materials out of silk fibroin, the protein that gives silk its durability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then they manipulated the bulk materials with water-soluble molecules to create multiple solid forms, from the nano- to the micro-scale, that have embedded, pre-designed functions, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, the researchers created a surgical pin that changes colour as it nears its mechanical limits and is about to fail, functional screws that can be heated on demand in response to infrared light, and a biocompatible component that enables the sustained release of bioactive agents, such as enzymes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The ability to embed functional elements in biopolymers, control their self-assembly, and modify their ultimate form creates significant opportunities for bio-inspired fabrication of high-performing multifunctional materials,&amp;quot; said senior study author Fiorenzo Omenetto, Professor at Tufts University in Massachusetts, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Silk's unique crystalline structure makes it one of nature's toughest materials.

The incidents included ransomware, financial frauds and website hacking in various Indian enterprises.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TAC Security's specially designed service -- Cyber Emergency Response Team (TAC-CERT) -- received hacking complaints that included seven distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, 12 E-mail hacks, 24 ransomware attacks, four financial frauds through email and six website hackings across verticals such as export companies, pharmaceutical companies, IT companies, manufacturers of electrical parts and a hospital. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the hospital experienced data breach, export companies encountered ransomware and financial loss while IT companies faced DDoS attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This shows how vulnerable we are. The risks are not confined to banks or financial institutions but rather every industry and domain that you can think of. Myriad reports confirm this fact,&amp;quot; said Trishneet Arora, CEO of TAC Security.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a move to help the organisations reduce the risk of hacking, Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has ordered a review of the entire IT infrastructure in the country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The government recently announced to set up the National Cyber Coordination Centre (NCCC) to provide near real-time situational awareness and rapid response to cyber attacks. The centre is expected to be operational by March 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ministry of Electronics and IT has also ordered review of the IT Act, 2000, and set up a crack team to respond to cyber security incidents quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;TAC CERT helps organisations in quick recovery by patching the loopholes and within hours, your service will be back to normal and function smoothly,&amp;quot; Arora added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 27 (IANS) A software analysis can now highlight the subtle differences between a diseased and healthy retina, a development that shows promise of early detection of diseases of the human eye and could also help design a smart phone-based retinal diagnostic app, researchers say.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The technique may also prove useful for identifying other types of tissue abnormalities from OCT images.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test that enables physicians to monitor alterations in the thickness of the retinal layer as disease progresses in the human retina.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at IISER-Kolkata, L.V. Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad and Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Mumbai developed a software analysis that was able to parse through the differences between a healthy retina and retinal layers of diabetic macular edema (DME) subjects from OCT images. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With OCT, each of the retina's distinctive layers can be seen, allowing ophthalmologists to map and measure their thickness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These measurements help with diagnosis and provide treatment guidance for glaucoma and retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic eye disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, subtle changes in the retinal layers due to early  disease progression are often not discernible. Our analysis can overcome  that drawback and pinpoint early disease progression. The software can directly tell us,&amp;quot; N.K. Das, IISER-Kolkata, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In the future, we can develop affordable and portable devices for early detection, including a smart-phone app where images can be fed through an optic fibre,&amp;quot; Das added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Published in the Journal of Biomedical Optics, the study is co-authored  by Nirmalya Ghosh, Sabyasachi Mukhopadhyay, Jay Chhablani, Ashutosh  Richhariya, Kompalli Divakar Rao and Naba Kishore Sahoo. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 27 (IANS) Breaking with its tradition of keeping research topics a secret, Apple has come out in the open, publishing its first artificial intelligence (AI) research paper that focuses on advanced image recognition.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple's first public research paper on AI was penned by vision expert Ashish Shrivastava and a team of engineers including Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Wenda Wang, Russ Webb and Apple Director of Artificial Intelligence Research Josh Susskind, appleinsider.com reported on Tuesday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shrivastava holds a PhD in computer vision from the University of Maryland.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Titled 'Learning from Simulated and Unsupervised Images through Adversarial Training', the paper describes techniques of training computer vision algorithms to recognise objects using synthetic, or computer generated, images.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the desired performance owing to a gap between synthetic and real image distributions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To reduce this gap, Apple has proposed Simulated plus Unsupervised (S+U) learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a simulator's output using unlabeled real data while preserving the annotation information from the simulator.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company has developed a method for S+U learning that uses an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The improved realism enables the training of better machine-learning models on large datasets without any data collection or human annotation effort. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, since machine learning models can be sensitive to artifacts in the synthetic data, S+U learning should generate images without artifacts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Apple's first public research paper was penned by vision expert Ashish Shrivastava and a team of engineers including Tomas Pfister, Oncel Tuzel, Wenda Wang, Russ Webb and Apple Director of Artificial Intelligence Research Josh Susskind,&amp;quot; the report added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/gb/na/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 27 (IANS) If you are baffled at the speed at which jokes, videos and GIFs reach your WhatsApp account from groups or friends almost at the same time, remember that such posts are being planned and executed by teams sitting in some corner of the country to bombard the maximum number accounts at one go.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With 160 million users in India, the Facebook-owned mobile messaging app has become a top choice among marketers, social influencers and certain groups to reach them via jokes, videos and GIFs whenever there is a breaking news, a major announcement, a tongue-in-cheek celebrity statement or even a festival, say experts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;WhatsApp is emerging as a highly susceptible channel for propaganda, misinformation, fake news as well as highly influenceable from the targeted marketing message or advertisement perspective, i.e., digital word-of-mouth,&amp;quot; Neil Shah, Research Director (Devices &amp;amp; Ecosystems) at the market research firm Counterpoint Research, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, WhatsApp has the highest penetration among any &amp;quot;social-centric&amp;quot; web/app platform available on the nearly 260 million active smartphone users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Several marketers are leveraging an infantry of smart or influential folks to develop and spread targeted and viral-natured content. I believe the viral messages developed and spread are not by a single source but many individuals and firms working on this behind the scenes,&amp;quot; Shah added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are ways to populate the sharing of such viral content but it can be defined in two parts -- content and objective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While objectives and the purposes could be anything, one can easily relate these with driving mass awareness, creating social buzz, dragging public attention on political or public issues or making fun among friends or sharing memes or news,&amp;quot; Anoop Mishra, one of the nation's leading social media experts, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social media or digital marketing agencies work behind the content marketing strategies to make stories viral and shareable on WhatsApp.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Several FMCG companies, major political parties and politicians have their in-house sponsored team of social media warriors to generate and share such content or hashtags on various social media platforms,&amp;quot; Mishra noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Shah, among several social media platforms, WhatsApp has a clear edge because of its user-friendly approach which has put the platform in a strong (as well as vulnerable position) for flow of both good and bad news or information or any content across the platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Since the degree of separation among different WhatsApp users is theoretically lower, there is a high chance for any information to go viral faster than any other social media platform or even word-of-mouth,&amp;quot; said Shah.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With some 150 million active users in India, Facebook is the second-most used social media platform and can also act as a catalyst for proliferation of viral content due to a broader sharing and a greater engagement with the content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;However, Facebook is quite curated and controlled via an algorithm according to a person's social graph and Facebook's advertising engine and, hence, potentially less viral than Whatsapp,&amp;quot; Shah pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook's third property, Instagram, is also quickly rising to become a popular platform from the perspective of social media influencers to drive rich content for marketers and mainly target millennials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is there a revenue model in there for those making posts viral? &amp;quot;Absolutely, wherever there is a greater reach and high engagement for any platform, a potential revenue model certainly exists,&amp;quot; Shah stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owing to its &amp;quot;no ads&amp;quot; DNA, WhatsApp has so far been resistant to a direct engagement-driven revenue model. However, with Facebook connecting WhatsApp to its social graph, it unlocks potential for Facebook to work with marketers who, in turn, work with influencers to build a robust value chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Right now with WhatsApp its much more unorganised and influencers are earning directly from the marketers without any Facebook or Whatsapp intervention, unlike the Facebook or Instagram platforms,&amp;quot; Shah told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Mishra, the content is being prepared by digital marketing agencies with some earning prospects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But the reality is that more than 80 per cent of the images or videos shared among the WhatsApp groups are downloaded from websites without any personal revenue benefits excepts some blogging sites which are paying their members for posts, comments, likes or to share contentson linked social profiles,&amp;quot; Mishra told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On August 25, WhatsApp made extensive changes to its privacy policy, announcing it would and could share users' personal information, including their phone numbers, with its parent company Facebook -- a move that drew sharp criticism from privacy activists and the Delhi High Court in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The move was touted as the first step towards monetising WhatsApp since Facebook acquired it for $19 billion in 2014.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Right now, WhatsApp is quite fragmented and unorganised compared to Facebook. We believe this will change fast as Facebook tries to indirectly monetise the power of WhatsApp as a 'content sharing and targeting' platform,&amp;quot; Shah added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Nishant Arora can be contacted at nishant.a@ians.in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/tb/sac&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 27 (IANS) The $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn can propel technology giant Microsoft to be the first tech company to attain a market value of $1 trillion, an analyst has said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A report in GeekWire on Monday quoted Michael Markowski, who writes for Equities, as saying that Microsoft will reach that threshold before other big companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Microsoft will do it by leveraging LinkedIn to become a leader in social media and the emerging crowdfunding industry,&amp;quot; the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;A pair of rulings from the US Securities and Exchange Commission this year opened up crowdfunding by letting companies directly advertise to the public&amp;quot; the report said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;And allowing those who are not accredited investors -- those making more than $200,000 a year or with a net worth in excess of $1 million -- to participate in more types of investments,&amp;quot; it added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Markowski's predictions, online crowdfunding would be the next technological revolution, at par with the creation of the internet, email, social media, smartphones and apps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The public has an insatiable appetite for making small bets and purchasing lottery tickets, etc., that provide the chance to make a big profit,&amp;quot; Markowski said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The millennials will be a good example. Many will want to routinely invest $100 or even less into high-risk ventures that could produce returns of 10X to 100X,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having monopoly on the business on social media sphere, Microsoft, with the acquisition of LinkedIn, would be able to take advantage of this trend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big technology companies would eventually build services to facilitate crowdfunding investments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion in an all-cash deal which was billed as one of the largest acquisitions in the social media space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/in/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 27 (IANS) Pakistan and Israel have been led to a verbal feud, threatening each other of nuclear war after a fake news story caused tensions between the two nuclear nations.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a report on CNN on Monday, in an article published by AWDNews on Tuesday, December 20, former Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon was falsely quoted as threatening to destroy Pakistan if it sent troops to Syria.

\&amp;quot;We will destroy them with a nuclear attack,\&amp;quot; the article falsely quoted Yaalon as saying. 

Mistaking the news as real, Pakistan Defence Minister Khawaja Asif responded on his official Twitter handle, \&amp;quot;Israeli (defence minister) threatens nuclear retaliation presuming (Pakistan) role in Syria against Daesh. Israel forgets Pakistan is a Nuclear State, too.\&amp;quot;

Soon, Israeli Ministry of Defence responded to Pakistan on Twitter, saying that the Yaalon\'s statement quoted in the report was entirely false.

\&amp;quot;The statement attributed to (former Defence Minister) Yaalon (regarding) Pakistan was never said,\&amp;quot; the ministry tweeted on its account, adding \&amp;quot;Reports referred to by the Pakistani Defence Minister are entirely false.\&amp;quot;

Later on Christmas, Asif said in a tweet that their nuclear programme was only a \&amp;quot;deterrence to protect\&amp;quot; their freedom.

\&amp;quot;We desire to coexist in peace, both in our region and beyond,\&amp;quot; Asif tweeted.

The spread of fake news on internet has been recently a matter of serious concern. 

Recently, critics blamed Facebook for influencing the US elections in favour of President-elect Donald Trump by circulating a \&amp;quot;host of fake news stories about political topics\&amp;quot;.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Beijing, Dec 26 (IANS) China successfully tested its newest twin-engine radar-evading, fifth generation stealth fighter, local media reported on Monday, citing sources in the aviation industry. The FC-31 Gyrfalcon can carry 8 tons of weapons and is said to be worth around $70 million.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The revamped version of what was previously known as the J-31 made its debut flight in the northeastern city of Shenyang on Friday, the state-owned China Daily reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trailblazing aircraft was the brainchild of Shenyang Aircraft Corp, part of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to AVIC, the FC-31 has a maximum take-off weight of 28 metric tons, a flight radius of 1,250 km, and a top speed of Mach 1.8 or 1.8 times the speed of sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aircraft can easily carry 8 tons of weapons, holding six missiles in its internal weapons bay, plus six more under its wings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sergey Kornev, head of Russia's Air Force Equipment Export Department, earlier told RIA Novosti the J-31 will fly on Russian aircraft engines RD-93.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A publicity officer at AVIC, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the flight test to the China Daily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The FC-31 first came under the spotlight in 2012 when the first prototype managed to stay airborne for as long as 11 minutes during a test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new fighter boasts a number of improvements over the previous one, experts say. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Compared with the first FC-31, there are a lot of improvements on the second prototype. Changes were made to the airframe, wings and vertical tails, which make it leaner, lighter and more maneuverable,&amp;quot; Wu Peixin, an aviation industry observer in Beijing, told the newspaper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The only fifth-generation fighter jet currently available on the market is the US Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a single-engine combat aircraft designed to perform ground attack and air defence missions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Lockheed Martin, it is the &amp;quot;world's most advanced&amp;quot; multi-role fighter, boasting &amp;quot;unmatched capabilities&amp;quot; to military forces around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ahm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bhubaneswar, Dec 26 (IANS) India on Monday moved a step closer to join the super exclusive club of countries with nuclear-capable inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBM) by successfully test-firing the indigenously developed Agni-V off the Odisha coast.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once the Agni-V is inducted, India would be among the league of the nations like the US, Russia, China, France and Britain with ICBM capability.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated Agni-V maker Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on the successful test of the missile that can carry nuclear warheads to a range of 5,000 km -- long enough to reach northern China. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Successful test firing of Agni-V makes every Indian very proud. It will add tremendous strength to our strategic defence,&amp;quot; Modi said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;President Mukherjee, the supreme commander of the Indian armed forces, said the missile &amp;quot;will enhance our strategic and deterrence capabilities&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the fourth test of the missile, developed and successfully tested by the DRDO under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The missile was launched around 11.05 a.m. from a mobile launcher complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at the Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast in Balasore district, a Defence Ministry statement said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The four-range test flight of the missile has further boosted the indigenous missile capabilities and deterrence level of the country,&amp;quot; the statement said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;All the mission objectives were successfully met.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The canisterised version of the missile was earlier successfully test-fired on January 31 this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the Agni-V missile, V.K. Saraswat, former DRDO chief and Niti Aayog member, said: &amp;quot;Right from the beginning, the missile was designed for the canisterised version.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Agni-V has all the capability to meet evolving threat and operational requirement of India. Now, we should look for introduction of force multipliers like MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) in the missile.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Agni-V missile, in its operational form, is designed to be stored and launched from the canister, enhancing its storage, operational readiness, transportability, response time and shelf life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIRV is a missile payload with several warheads, each capable of being aimed at independent targets. This helps in reducing the efficiency of the anti-ballistic missile capability of the adversary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The missile employs Ring Laser Gyro-based Inertial Navigation System (RINS) and Micro Navigation System (MINS) for navigation, which support it to reach the target point within a few metres of accuracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the success of the test, Agni-V is a step closer for induction into the strategic arsenal of India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saraswat, who was the DRDO chief when Agni-V was first tested in April 2012, said it won't be too long before the missile is inducted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We are using proven technology which does not require large number of tests. DRDO today has high level of instrumentation and the processing capability on ground as well as in the missile is high,&amp;quot; he noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DRDO has been steadily increasing the range of the missiles through redesigning the operational missiles for longer ranges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about Agni-V missile's capability to launch satellite, Saraswat said: &amp;quot;It is a building block. It can be used to deliver satellites, below 100 kg weight, into the lower earth orbit (LEO) with addition of a small injecting stage in the missile. We had made studies at that time.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A LEO satellite can be launched during the war to gather information on the &amp;quot;theatre battlefields&amp;quot; for specific requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The three-stage 17 metres long, 2-metre wide, 50-tonne Agni-V is capable of delivering nuclear warhead of over a tonne.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Agni-V's second test was conducted on September 15, 2013, and the third on January 31, 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fourth test was expected in the first quarter of 2016. However, a technical snag in the battery led to delay in the test, DRDO chief S. Christopher had told IANS. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rs-ao/sar/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Tokyo, Dec 26 (IANS) Examining cucumber seedlings germinated under the very weak gravity -- or microgravity -- conditions of the International Space Station, researchers from Japan's Tohoku University have discovered how a protein helps plants sense gravity to boost their chances of survival.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Plants are experts in survival and can control the direction of their roots to maximise the use of resources around them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using specialised cells, they can sense gravity and redistribute hormones, called auxins, to stimulate growth and allow vital features of the plant to develop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, a big puzzle is how this transport process occurs at a cellular level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, reported in the journal Nature Microgravity and using samples grown on board the International Space Station, the research team highlighted the valuable contribution of the gravity-sensitive CsPIN1 protein to this process. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The role of the protein in facilitating the transport of the growth hormones had first been suggested in previous experiments conducted on Earth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To gain further insight, the researchers loaded cucumber seeds into specially designed canisters, which were sent up to the space station. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cucumbers were chosen for the study as they -- like other &amp;quot;cucurbitaceous&amp;quot; seedlings such as melons, pumpkins and squash -- feature specialised protuberances, or pegs, whose formation is regulated by gravity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These pegs form during the plant's early growth stage to help the seedlings emerge from their hard seed coat and anchor the developing plant in the soil while its roots form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The experiment showed that CsPIN1 protein can relocalise under the influence of gravity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Specifically, this change in the position of protein was found to occur in the so-called transition zone of the cucumber seedling where the pegs develop. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This behaviour stimulates the formation of a cellular canal capable of transporting growth hormones from one side of this zone to the other, the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Put simply, these findings point towards the mechanism by which the seeds are able to turn on and off the growth of their anchoring pegs in relation to their orientation with respect to gravity. And, as result, boost their chances of survival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bhubaneswar, Dec 26 (IANS) India on Monday successfully test-fired its indigenously developed intercontinental surface-to-surface nuclear-capable ballistic missile Agni-V from the Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast in Balasore district.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the fourth and final test of the missile, developed and successfully tested by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, according to defence sources. 

It was launched around 11.05 a.m. from a mobile launcher complex-4 of the Integrated Test Range (ITR), the sources said.

\&amp;quot;We are analysing the test launch after collecting information from radars. The report suggests it is a successful launch,\&amp;quot; said an official source.

On January 31, the canisterised version of the missile was successfully test-fired.

Speaking about the Agni-V missile, V.K. Saraswat, former DRDO chief and Niti Aayog member, said: \&amp;quot;Right from the beginning, the missile was designed for the canisterised version.\&amp;quot; 

\&amp;quot;Agni-V has all the capability to meet evolving threat and operational requirement of India. Now, we should look for introduction of force multipliers like MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) in the missile.\&amp;quot;

The Agni-V missile, in its operational form is designed to be stored and launched from the canister, enhancing its storage, operational readiness, transportability, response time and shelf life.

MIRV is a missile payload with several warheads, each capable of being aimed at independent targets. This helps in reducing the efficiency of the anti-ballistic missile capability of the adversary.

The missile employs Ring Laser Gyro-based Inertial Navigation System (RINS) and Micro Navigation System (MINS) for navigation, which support the missile to reach the target point within a few metres of accuracy.

With the success of the final development test, Agni-V is now ready for induction into the strategic arsenal of India.

On why only four tests for clearing the missile for operations, Saraswat said, \&amp;quot;DRDO conducted 30-odd launches before inducting Prithvi missiles. Those were the initial days.\&amp;quot; 

\&amp;quot;Now, we are using proven technology which does not require large number of tests. DRDO today has high level of instrumentation and the processing capability on ground as well as in the missile is high.\&amp;quot;

DRDO has been steadily increasing the range of the missiles through redesigning the operational missiles for longer ranges.

Speaking about Agni-V missile\'s capability to launch satellite, Saraswat said, \&amp;quot;It is a building block. It can be used to deliver satellites, below 100 kg weight, into the lower earth orbit (LEO) with addition of a small injecting stage in the missile. We had made studies at that time.\&amp;quot;

A LEO satellite can be launched during the war to gather information on the \&amp;quot;theatre battlefields\&amp;quot; for specific requirements.

Agni-V was first tested in 2012 when V.K. Saraswat was the Secretary, DRDO.

The Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Agni-V has the capability to strike targets anywhere in all of Asia and parts of Africa and Europe.

The three-stage 17 metres long, 2-metre wide, 50-tonne Agni-V is capable of delivering nuclear warhead of over a tonne to a distance of more than 5,000 km.

Once the Agni-V is inducted into the Indian military, India would join the super exclusive club of countries with ICBMs alongside the US, Russia, China, France and Britain.

The first test of Agni-V was conducted on April 19, 2012, while the second test was launched on September 15, 2013.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 26 (IANS) Though mobile data plans in India are among the cheapest in the world and average retail price of smartphones is steadily declining, yet nearly 950 million Indians do not have an Internet connection, according to a joint study done by Assocham-Deloitte.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Internet penetration is increasing in India, the access to affordable broadband, smart devices and monthly data packages is required to spread digital literacy to make their ends meet,&amp;quot; said the study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study titled 'Strategic national measures to combat cybercrime' said: &amp;quot;Existing government infrastructure assets should be further leveraged for provision of digital services at remote locations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Digital literacy needs to be increased by providing institutional training in schools, colleges and universities; accelerating partnerships with global technology leaders and using the workforce trained under Skill India to impart training.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It said an integrated approach between Digital India and Skill India needs to be constructed to design programmes and impart training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saying that the government should increase awareness regarding the value add of technology to increase technology adoption, the study added that the benefits of technology -- increase in the standard of living of the weaker sections of society and enhancing financial inclusion should be communicated to citizens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Private sector players should be incentivised to develop infrastructure, provide services and promote digital literacy as part of the Digital India programme. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Start-ups should be involved to create and customise apps to local needs to increase adoption of digital technology,&amp;quot; added the joint study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It said the top barriers to adoption of technologies in the economically weaker sections of society as well as in micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) include cost and affordability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Most telecom operators so far have not invested significantly in development of high speed access networks in rural areas. Similarly, MSMEs also have low awareness of government and stakeholder schemes that could lead to numerous benefits,&amp;quot; the study said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It said a key hindrance to adoption of technology is the low rate of digital literacy in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Several initiatives undertaken by the government and other organisations are expected to improve the digital literacy rate in the coming years which will in turn result in an increase in adoption of technology and digital services.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/in/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Patna, Dec 26 (IANS) Two days ahead of formal launch of protest against demonetisation, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family have taken to social media to drum up support for the party's campaign against 'notebandi'.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bihar's number one political family has been using Facebook and Twitter, for the first time, to denounce Prime Minister Narendra Modi's demonetisation move and its impact.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demonetisation has created joblessness, slowed down businesses, hit hard farmers and common people, who are struggling to withdraw their own money, the family members of Lalu Prasad have said on social media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rich people and corporates who hoard black money are not worried and are enjoying after demonetisation, they said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalu, his wife and former Chief Minister Rabri Devi, their two sons Tej Pratap Yadav and Tejaswi Yadav, who are ministers in the Bihar cabinet, and elder daughter Misa Bharti have been active on social media with slogans and short statements against the central government's move, its negative impact on the economy and employment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tej Pratap, 28, who is Bihar Health Minister, Tejaswi, 27, who is the Deputy Chief Minister, and Misa, a Rajya Sabha member from the Rashtriya Janata Dal party, have been targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to propagate their party's protest against demonetisation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The RJD will on December 28 stage a sit-in at all district headquarters across the state. Lalu and Rabri Devi will join the sit-in in Patna. The party will hold a huge rally here early next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalu has been attacking the Prime Minister for flop demontisation show and his government's failure to implement the decision properly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Demonetisation has caused harm to the country, affected the economy and poor have been struggling,&amp;quot; Lalu posted on Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalu on Sunday tweeted: &amp;quot;The government has been looting poor in the name of demonetisation... Poor people have been standing in queues and the rich are partying.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rabri Devi posted on Facebook: &amp;quot;The corrupt are enjoying and the poor are struggling.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tejaswi has urged people, particularly the youths, to ensure success of the &amp;quot;mahadharna&amp;quot; and awaken the Modi government from its deep sleep to help the rich and corrupt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tej Pratap has asked whether it was the &amp;quot;achche din&amp;quot; that the BJP had promised. &amp;quot;The blind king is enjoying after taking away employment of the youths and poor people.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Misa on Facebook posted Forbes's statement against demonetisation to highlight the opinion of the world's leading business magazine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalu Prasad last week attacked Modi for openly &amp;quot;advertising&amp;quot; for Paytm, which is co-owned by a Chinese company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Has there been any Indian Prime Minister who openly advertises a Chinese company and says do Paytm,&amp;quot; he tweeted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier, he targeted Modi's decision saying it has failed and would meet the same fate as the Congress' forced sterilisation in the mid-70s during the Emergency period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Demonetisation will meet the same fate as forced sterilisation,&amp;quot; the RJD chief said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It is not 'notebandi' but the 'farzibandi' that has put common people in deep trouble,&amp;quot; Lalu Prasad said, adding that Modi has cheated people.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leader reminded Modi of his promise made ahead of the Lok Sabha polls of bringing back the black money stashed abroad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The black money has not been brought back and the Rs 15 lakh, which Narendra Modi promised, has not been deposited in anyone's bank account yet.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalu Prasad has been opposing the move to demonetise the Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes ever since its announcement on November 8, unlike Janata Dal-United President and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who is supporting it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalu a few days ago claimed that Kumar will review the impact of demonetisation after 50 days and respond to the central government accordingly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ik/py/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Bengaluru, Dec 26 (IANS) If you think shopping is women's forte, think again. According to the e-commerce platform Flipkart, over 60 per cent of customers who purchased electronics, personal audio, footwear and lifestyle products on its platform in 2016 were men.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the #FlipTrends2016 study, 25-34-year-olds comprised the most active shoppers online. Interestingly, 15 per cent of shoppers on Flipkart were from the over 45 years age group, which surprisingly had been thought to be more resistant to online shopping. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings analysed the online shopping preferences of more than 100 million customers across India from January 1 to December 15.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Top brands that remained favourite throughout the year were Samsung, Lenovo, SanDisk, Mi and UCB. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2016, sales of branded products across categories saw a sharp increase, as more of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Indian towns took to shopping online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Categories like apparel, smartphones and electronics dominated online sales this year. Eighty per cent of our traffic comes from mobile,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indians were seen buying aspirational products and high-value items such as premium phones, consumer electronics and appliances. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;anuj/na/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Melbourne, Dec 26 (IANS) An international team of astronomers has found a massive supercluster of galaxies that had previously gone undetected as it was hidden by stars and dust in the Milky Way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Vela supercluster is a huge mass that influenced the motion of our galaxy, said Professor Matthew Colless from Australian National University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This is one of the biggest concentrations of galaxies in the Universe -- possibly the biggest in the neighbourhood of our Galaxy, but that will need to be confirmed by further study,&amp;quot; Colless added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The gravity of the Vela supercluster may explain the difference between the measured motion of the Milky Way through space and the motion predicted from the distribution of previously mapped galaxies,&amp;quot; Colless, who used the Anglo-Australian telescope to measure distances for many galaxies, explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research -- published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society -- involved astronomers based in South Africa, Australia and Europe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two new Australian surveys starting in 2017 will confirm the size of the Vela supercluster, according to the researchers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Taipan optical survey will measure galaxy distances over a bigger area around Vela, while the WALLABY radio survey will be able to peer through the densest parts of the Milky Way into the supercluster's heart,&amp;quot; Colless pointed out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 26 (IANS) In the crowded smartphone market for 5 and 5.5-inch displays, there is a dedicated space for those who love to have phablets in their digital lives. Chinese smartphone maker Lenovo recently expanded its Phab series with Phab 2 Plus which is stricly for those looking for heavy media consumption.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rs 14,999 device is in direct contest with Xiaomi\'s Mi Max that has the same specifications and price and was launched in May 2016.

Is Lenovo better than Mi Max? Let\'s find out.

Phab 2 Plus has an all-metal body with a Gorilla Glass display and curvy back. The 6.44-inch display is quite immersive at maximum brightness. Even though the device offers a one-handed mode, you actually need to use both hands to work seamlessly on it.

The fingerprint scanner at the back panel is very responsive. There is a hybrid SIM tray on the left and volume and power buttons at right.

The striking feature that differentiates Phab 2 Plus from Mi Max is its rear dual-camera setup with LED flash.

Phab 2 Plus, however, comes with the not-so-popular octa-core MediaTek processor (MT8783), 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The device runs on the near-stock Android Marshmallow.

In Settings, you can find features like \&amp;quot;Smart Assist\&amp;quot; for one-handed mode, change volume when picking up the phone and auto-answer a call.

The device performed brilliant during constant gaming, long movie-watching hours or surfing.

The Dolby Atmos audio is one of the striking features. The app lets you choose from multiple sound profiles. Phab 2 Plus ships with JBL earphones that deliver decent audio quality (we suggest that users consume content that has Dolby support).

Lenovo Phab 2 Plus features two 13-megapixel camera sensors. Lenovo claimed that the secondary camera provides depth in a photo and it was right. The continuous autofocus works well even with video.

The AR camera seems to be inspired by augmented-reality game \&amp;quot;Pokemon Go\&amp;quot;.

Mi Max, however, scores with 4,850mAh battery. Lenovo\'s 4,050mAh battery delivered nearly 19-hour backup during a marathon session of content consumption.

In the loop test, the device returned four hours 39 minutes when we played two full-HD movies.

What doesn\'t work?

Phab 2 Plus heats up easily, has a smaller battery as compared to its only competition in the Indian market and the dual-camera setup is not very impressive.

Conclusion: The positives will surely make the choice difficult between Phab 2 Plus and Mi Max. If you are an audiophile, go for Phab 2 Plus. The near-stock Android is a treat.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Jerusalem, Dec 26 (IANS) Ministers in Israel have approved a bill - dubbed the &amp;quot;Facebook bill&amp;quot; - that seeks to compel social media providers such as Facebook, Twitter or  YouTube to immediately remove contents from their platforms that the Israeli courts consider incitements that could lead to violence or terrorism.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bill that would apply to posts that &amp;quot;call for an act of violence or terrorism&amp;quot; passed a Ministerial Committee for Legislation vote on Sunday, The Jerusalem Post reported on Sunday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Facebook and other social networking platforms such as Twitter currently remove contents related to hate speech, violence and terrorism on government requests but they are not required everywhere to act immediately and remove all posts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Israel is not the first country in the world to pass [such a] law. There's similar legislation in various states in the US, in Canada, Australia, and the UK,&amp;quot; the Post quoted  Adam Snukal, IP and technology shareholder in the Tel Aviv office of international law firm Greenberg Traurig, LLP as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Incitement leads to terrorism, but Facebook and other social media companies do not respond to all of the police's requests to remove such content, or take a long time to do so,&amp;quot; Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the bill, which has raised concerns about restrictions on free speech, becomes a law, social media providers would no longer have such liberty of judging the merit of each request in Israel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the bill, the state would be able to seek court orders to remove content without giving the social-media platform advance notice, based on classified evidence or evidence that would not be considered admissible in other cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social media platforms are also doing their bit to make the removal of online terrorists content more effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help enforce policies against online terrorist content, internet giants Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube earlier said they were creating a shared database to help enforce policies against online terrorist content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Just this month, Facebook, along with other US tech companies, announced the creation of a shared industry database of 'hashes' - unique digital 'fingerprints' - of violent terrorist videos or images, to enable us to act on such content even more quickly,&amp;quot; a representative of Facebook in Israel was quoted as saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 25 (IANS) Using ultrafast imaging of moving energy, scientists have determined the speed of photosynthesis.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study said the imaging could help scientists better understand the process and how it could be copied for producing fuels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier, it was believed that the process of charge separation in the reaction was the slowest step in the process. But scientists have shown that the slowest step is in fact the process through which the plants harvest light and transfer its energy through the antennae to the reaction centre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We can now see how nature has optimised the physics of converting light energy to fuel, and can probe this process using our new technique of ultrafast crystal measurements,&amp;quot; said Jasper van Thor from Imperial College, London.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For example, is it important that the bottleneck occurs at this stage, in order to preserve overall efficiency? Can we mimic it or tune it to make artificial photosynthesis more efficient? These questions, and many others, can now be explored,&amp;quot; Thor added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists used lasers to cause reactions in crystals of Photosystem II -- enzyme that uses the light energy to split water into oxygen and hydrogen -- and then measured in space and time the movement of excitations of electrons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The resulting movie of the movement of excited electrons across minute sections of the system revealed where energy is held and when it is passed along,&amp;quot; the study noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 25 (IANS) A new research in cognitive science suggests that our memory also records physical sensations as part of the words stored.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a study published in research journal 'PLOS One', similar to an entry in a reference book, the brain records a word like 'whisk', associating it with concepts such as 'inanimate' and 'kitchen device'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In addition to this, the brain connects the word to one's own experience -- how a whisk feels, for instance, and that a spinning motion is related to it,&amp;quot; the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was conducted with 28 participants, and it was found that when the study participants had to grasp an object while reading, their brain processed parts of the meaning of the words earlier than in previous studies in which words were evaluated without something being gripped.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The participants sat in front of a computer screen, where three cubes were lying next to each other on the tabletop -- one about the size of an apple, one the size of a table tennis ball and one the size of a dice. On the screen behind the cubes, three white fields were displayed. Words then appeared in one of the fields on the screen -- sometimes made-up words, sometimes real ones. When a pseudo-word such as &amp;quot;whask&amp;quot; was displayed, the participants did not have to do anything. But if a real noun like &amp;quot;orange&amp;quot; appeared, they were supposed to grip the cube corresponding to that respective field,&amp;quot; the study explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of an Electroencephalography (EEG) electrode cap that recorded brain activity, researchers evaluated how the word was processed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier researchers have shown that it takes a brain a third of a second to process a word.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In our study, however, we were able to show that comprehension can already begin much earlier, after just a tenth of a second -- if a grasping action is required,&amp;quot; explained Dirk Koester, Bielefeld University, Germany.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This study not only provides evidence that the brain has a common control center for language and movement, but it also shows that our brain's processing steps shift very quickly and adjust to current tasks - in this case, the task of grasping something while reading,&amp;quot; Koester added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the researchers, the method could offer an approach for new therapies, such as treating stroke patients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 25 (IANS) Driverless cars can save fuel if they trail each other in large platoons, as they will experience less aerodynamic drag when they drive close together, researchers have found.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But formation of a vehicle platoon could be time consuming.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study by the researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that was recently presented at the International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics suggested that relatively simple, straightforward schedules may be the optimal approach for saving fuel and minimising delays for autonomous vehicle fleets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings may also apply to conventional long-distance trucking and even ride-sharing services.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Ride-sharing and truck platooning and even flocking birds and formation flight, are similar problems from a systems point of view,&amp;quot; said Sertac Karaman, Associate Professor at MIT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;People who study these systems only look at efficiency metrics like delay and throughput. We look at those same metrics, versus sustainability such as cost, energy, and environmental impact. This line of research might really turn transportation on its head,&amp;quot; Karaman added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research noted that for truck-driving -- particularly over long distances -- most of a truck's fuel is spent on trying to overcome aerodynamic drag, that is, to push the truck through the surrounding air.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Scientists have previously calculated that if several trucks were to drive just a few metres apart, one behind the other, those in the middle should experience less drag, saving fuel by as much as 20 per cent, while the last truck should save 15 per cent -- slightly less, due to air currents that drag behind,&amp;quot; the study found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the number of vehicles are increased in the platoon, more energy can be collectively saved but it may cost in terms of time it takes to form a platoon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that the simplest policies resulted in least delays in platoon formation while saving most fuel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Time tables set to deploy platoons at regular intervals were more sustainable and efficient than those that deployed at more staggered times,&amp;quot; the study mentioned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>London, Dec 25 (IANS) British researchers have discovered a new genetic disease which results in neuro-degeneration and help find treatments for brain ageing conditions, such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study revealed that the disease -- ataxia oculomotor apraxia type XRCC1 -- is caused by a genetic mutation that disrupts the repair of our DNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study showed that when single strands of our DNA are damaged, a genetic mutation in a gene called XRCC1 causes a vital DNA-repairing enzyme (known as PARP1) in our bodies to over-activate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In people suffering from the new disease, the speeding up of this key enzyme actually triggers the death of brain cells, the researchers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Discovering this new disease and its cause is a huge step towards developing drug-based therapies for other rare neurodegenerative conditions,&amp;quot; said lead author Keith Caldecott, Professor at University of Sussex.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Drugs which target this key DNA repairing enzyme in the right way, could prove vital for treating people suffering from diseases caused by the over-activation of this protein - it is now crucial we determine what diseases these are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Single strand breaks are one of the most common types of DNA damage and the researchers believe it's possible the discovery of this new genetic disease could be important for scientists researching other rare DNA repair related diseases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details appeared in the journal Nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/sm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Toronto, Dec 25 (IANS) If countries abide by the Paris Agreement's global warming target of 1.5 degrees Celsius, potential fish catches could increase by six million metric tonnes per year, estimates a new study.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also found that some oceans are more sensitive to changes in temperature and will have substantially larger gains from achieving the Paris Agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The benefits for vulnerable tropical areas is a strong reason why 1.5 Celsius is an important target to meet,&amp;quot; said lead author William Cheung, Associate Professor at University of British Columbia in Canada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Countries in these sensitive regions are highly dependent on fisheries for food and livelihood, but all countries will be impacted as the seafood supply chain is now highly globalised. Everyone would benefit from meeting the Paris Agreement,&amp;quot; Cheung said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors compared the Paris Agreement 1.5 Celsius warming scenario to the currently pledged 3.5 Celsius by using computer models to simulate changes in global fisheries and quantify losses or gains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The findings -- published in the journal Science - showed that for every degree Celsius decrease in global warming, potential fish catches could increase by more than three metric million tonnes per year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous UBC research shows that today's global fish catch is roughly 109 million metric tonnes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Changes in ocean conditions that affect fish stocks, such as temperature and oxygen concentration, are strongly related to atmospheric warming and carbon emissions,&amp;quot; Thomas Frolicher from ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich) in Switzerland, explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For every metric tonne of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, the maximum catch potential decreases by a significant amount,&amp;quot; Frolicher said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 25 (IANS) Researchers have identified a genetic immune disorder characterised by increased susceptibility and poor immune control of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and, in some cases, an EBV-associated cancer called Hodgkin's lymphoma.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers studied two unrelated sets of siblings with similar immune problems and determined their symptoms were likely caused by a lack of CD70, a protein found on the surface of several types of immune cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted the research with an international team of collaborators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both sets of siblings had evidence of uncontrolled infection with EBV, a common and usually mild virus, which resulted in the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma in three of these children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each child also had other immune symptoms, such as reduced activity of pathogen-fighting T cells, low production of antibodies and poor activation of antibody-producing B cells.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers analysed the genomes of all four children and found that each had two mutated copies of the CD70 gene, resulting in nonfunctioning or nonexistent CD70 proteins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All four parents, who had healthy immune systems, had only one copy of the mutation--indicating that CD70 deficiency follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This means affected individuals receive a flawed gene from each parent in order to have symptoms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While no specific treatment for CD70 deficiency currently exists, each of the four children has recovered from Hodgkin's lymphoma and is receiving antibody infusions to help bolster the immune system, the researchers recently reported in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sm/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

His latest sports drama &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot;, which released two days before the festival, generated over Rs 29 crore on its opening day.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the numbers shared by Disney India, which is backing the film, &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot; minted Rs 29.78 crore, including Rs 59 lakh from Tamil and Telugu, in India on Friday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Directed by Nitesh Tiwari, &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot; is based on the real life tale of Mahavir Singh Phogat, a former national champion who, much to the disapproval of his wife and his whole village, trained his daughters Geeta and Babita to wrestle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were doubts about the film's box office performance getting affected by the Indian government's demonetisation move. But it has started off on a strong note at the box office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film also made a good opening on BookMyShow as it contributed 33 per cent to the movie's total Day One India box office collection, read a statement from the online entertainment ticketing platform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The movie witnessed approximately 40 per cent more advance bookings on the platform for the opening week as compared to other blockbusters this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last few years, Aamir's films like &amp;quot;PK&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Dhoom: 3&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;3 Idiots&amp;quot; -- which released around Christmas -- turned out to be blockbusters. And it seems like &amp;quot;Dangal&amp;quot; will join the list soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sug/nn/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>San Francisco, Dec 24 (IANS) Amid the escalating patents row with Finnish smartphone maker Nokia, Apple has reportedly pulled all products made by Withings -- a French company and now a Nokia subsidiary -- from Apple Stores, be it online or retail.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several Withings iOS-compatible products -- mostly health-related connected accessories -- have been available at Apple Stores for nearly two years as part of a retail alliance, AppleInsider reported on Saturday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Withings product sales continued even after the company was acquired by Nokia in April for nearly $190 million. The Withings brand was integrated into Nokia's Digital Health unit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Now, the devices made by the Nokia subsidiary are no longer listed on Apple's website. Previously, Apple carried a wide range of iOS-compatible Withings devices in its retail stores, including the 'Body Cardio Scale' and 'Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor,'&amp;quot; the report added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an anti-trust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia's behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly earlier this week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nokia filed a suit in Europe and the US, claiming Apple is still infringing on Nokia patents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nokia said that since settling the initial case, Apple has &amp;quot;declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its lawsuit, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as &amp;quot;FRAND&amp;quot;  (Fair, Reasonable, and Non-Discriminatory). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money,&amp;quot; Apple argued.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the Cupertino-based tech giant, Nokia has been conspiring with PAEs patent assertion entities (Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management) in an &amp;quot;illegal patent transfer scheme&amp;quot; to wring money out of Apple because Nokia's cell phone business is failing. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;According to the AppleInsider report, Apple has now &amp;quot;expunged all mention of Withings and its product line from the Apple.com online retail database&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Whether or not the recent Withings removal is related to Nokia's shady legal dealings has yet to be confirmed, but Apple has in the past used its retail might as a retaliatory weapon,&amp;quot; the report added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, media reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 24 (IANS) If you closely followed the recently concluded US presidential election, you might have already realised what a new study confirms - providing contradictory evidence to change one's political beliefs may actually backfire.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People become more hard-headed in their political beliefs when provided with counter-evidence because the brain may perceive the challenges to political beliefs in the same way it perceives threat and anxiety, the study suggests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Political beliefs are like religious beliefs in the respect that both are part of who you are and important for the social circle to which you belong,&amp;quot; said lead author Jonas Kaplan from University of Southern California in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;To consider an alternative view, you would have to consider an alternative version of yourself,&amp;quot; Kaplan said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To determine which brain networks respond when someone holds firmly to a belief, the neuroscientists compared whether and how much people change their minds on nonpolitical and political issues when provided counter-evidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They discovered that people were more flexible when asked to consider the strength of their belief in nonpolitical statements -- for example, &amp;quot;Albert Einstein was the greatest physicist of the 20th century&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when it came to reconsidering their political beliefs, such as whether the US should reduce funding for the military, they would not budge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I was surprised that people would doubt that Einstein was a great physicist, but this study showed that there are certain realms where we retain flexibility in our beliefs,&amp;quot; Kaplan said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the study, the neuroscientists recruited 40 people who were self-declared liberals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The scientists then examined through functional MRI how their brains responded when their beliefs were challenged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study - published in the journal Scientific Reports - found that people who were most resistant to changing their beliefs had more activity in the amygdalae (a pair of almond-shaped areas near the center of the brain) and the insular cortex, compared with people who were more willing to change their minds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The activity in these areas, which are important for emotion and decision-making, may relate to how we feel when we encounter evidence against our beliefs,&amp;quot; Kaplan said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The amygdala in particular is known to be especially involved in perceiving threat and anxiety,&amp;quot; Kaplan added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The insular cortex processes feelings from the body, and it is important for detecting the emotional salience of stimuli. That is consistent with the idea that when we feel threatened, anxious or emotional, then we are less likely to change our minds,&amp;quot; Kaplan explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also noted that a system in the brain, the Default Mode Network, surged in activity when participants' political beliefs were challenged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These areas of the brain have been linked to thinking about who we are, and with the kind of rumination or deep thinking that takes us away from the here and now,&amp;quot; Kaplan said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/sar&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 24 (IANS) In 2016, science fiction and reality collided when LIGO opened up our sixth sense to understand the universe and set the ball rolling for a new era of observational astrophysics with the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Along the way, the international team of researchers associated with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) scientific collaboration picked up numerous accolades and inspired a new generation of scientists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The discovery of these elusive waves, a century after Albert Einstein's prediction, is undoubtedly the biggest physics success story in 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dubbed as &amp;quot;ripples in the curvature of space and time&amp;quot;, these waves will provide information on the cosmos that wouldn't have been possible by peering through any kind of telescope: to explore fundamental physics and could even offer a peep into the universe's earliest moments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The electrifying revelations by the 1,000-member LIGO also heralded a new chapter in India's future of new-age astrophysics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With India poised to set up a LIGO (the third in the world), scientists expect to hear space-time rhythms from Indian soil within next six to seven years, according to Karan P. Jani, one of the many US-based Indian researchers working on the project.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LIGO research is carried out by the international LIGO Scientific Collaboration (which includes the GEO Collaboration and the Australian Consortium for Interferometric Gravitational Astronomy) and the Virgo Collaboration in Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The LIGO-India project is envisaged as an international collaboration between the LIGO Laboratory and three lead institutions in the IndIGO consortium: Institute of Plasma Research (IPR) Gandhinagar, Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The window to the cosmos literally opened up on February 11, 2016, when LIGO announced the first-ever direct observation of gravitational waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The waves arose from the merger of two massive black holes 1.3 billion light years away and were recorded by both of LIGO's detectors - one in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were first tracked down on September 14, 2015, by both detectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The LIGO Observatories are funded by the National Science Foundation and were conceived, built, and are operated by Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A second gravitational-wave detection by LIGO was announced on June 15, 2016, also from merging black holes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After an upgrade, on November 30, scientists restarted the twin detectors of LIGO, after making several improvements to the system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hunt is back on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the year, the LIGO team and the founders were honoured with all major awards including the $3 million Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, the Kavli Prize and Gruber Prize in Cosmology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Special Breakthrough Prize would be shared between two groups of laureates - the three founders of LIGO and 1,012 contributors to the experiment, including 40 Indian researchers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gabriela Gonzalez, who serves as the spokesperson for the international collaboration, was named one of the top 10 scientists in the world by the scientific journal Nature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was also named one of the top 100 Leading Global Thinkers by Foreign Policy magazine for the collaboration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LIGO saw two strong gravitational wave events in its first four months, and possibly a third weaker signal. If that trend continues in the new run, researchers hope for, at least six events in the first half of 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another gravitational wave detector, Virgo, in Italy, is scheduled to be switched on in 2017 and combined with the twin LIGO detectors, they should be able to pinpoint the source of the waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides adding to the knowledge of the black hole population in the universe, the observatory could also quench science's thirst to detect gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars, believed to be the producers and distributors of the heavy elements, such as the precious metals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So far, technological developments that were made for LIGO have found independent applications in science as well as industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the discovery, related projects like the European Space Agency's LISA Pathfinder satellite (which reported record-breaking gravitational wave results) have also come under the spotlight for the possibility that the search for gravitational waves could one day occur in space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The LIGO discovery capped a decade-long search and is the unequivocal proof that Einstein's theory of general relativity was valid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It has spawned several other studies, including one which claims the discovery may have, in fact, invalidated Einstein's theory and instead indicate that the first signs of quantum gravity may have been found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2016 may have been a watershed year for new-age astrophysics, but 2017 could open the floodgates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(This is a part of a series of articles from IANS that look back at the year that was.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 23 (IANS) The foundation stone for India's first second generation ethanol bio-refinery to be set up by Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) at Bathinda in Punjab at a cost of Rs 600 crore will be laid on December 25, an official said on Friday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The foundation stone laying ceremony will be held at village Tarkhanwala, in Bathinda district of Punjab, a Petroleum Ministry release here said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The Government is encouraging production of second generation ethanol from agricultural residues to provide additional sources of remuneration to farmers, address the growing environmental concerns and support the Ethanol Blended Petrol (EBP) programme,&amp;quot; it said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bathinda bio-refinery will produce 100 kilolitres of ethanol per day, or 3.20 crore litres per annum, which may be sufficient to meet the 26 per cent of the ethanol blending requirement of Punjab, it added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the Ministry, the proposed bio-refinery will generate employment for about 1,200-1,300 persons in the biomass supply chain and generate an additional income of approximately Rs 20 crore per annum for farmers through purchase of their agriculture residues like sugarcane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The project shall also help in reducing CO2 emissions from the paddy straw which currently is being burnt after harvesting,&amp;quot; it said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bio-refinery will also produce about 30,000 tonnes of bio-fertiliser per annum that can be used as soil nutrient. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will also produce more than 1 lakh kilograms of Bio-CNG per annum which can cater to transport and clean cooking requirements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HPCL and other state-run oil firms are setting up 12 2G ethanol bio-refineries across 11 states at an estimated cost of Rs 10,000 crore, the statement said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;These Bio-refineries shall produce around 35- 40 crore litres of ethanol annually, thus contributing significantly towards the EBP programme,&amp;quot; it added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;bc/dg  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 23 (IANS) India needs focused attention to further the discipline of theoretical physics, where it is yet to match global standards, says Indian-American physicist Mani Bhaumik.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In the world standard, we are still behind. There are good people like Ashoke Sen (the string theorist) and good work is going on at Jadavpur University, TIFR and others. We are a developing country and we require more resources but we need to have the focus and desire to do well in the field,&amp;quot; Bhaumik told IANS here on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony by the Ophthalmological Society of West Bengal and Disha Eye Hospitals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the advantages that India has is that the researchers here have traditionally been contemplative and intuitive which is important for the growth of theoretical physics, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhaumik recently funded the establishment of the $11 million Mani L. Bhaumik Institute for Theoretical Physics at University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About this, he said the goal is to show the unification of all particles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faculty, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students at the Bhaumik Institute will address unanswered questions in all areas of theoretical physics. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Theoretical physicists attempt to determine the action of the laws of nature by constructing mathematical models of physical systems and solving the equations that underlie those models, sometimes aided by computers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in a remote village in West Bengal, Bhaumik rose from poverty to become an eminent scientist who played a key role in developing the laser technology that paved the way for Lasik eye surgery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/ssp/vd&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 23 (IANS) Researchers have discovered a dinosaur species that shed its &amp;quot;milk teeth&amp;quot; but did not replace them, a finding that not only changes its anatomy but also explains why birds have beaks and not teeth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Limusaurus inextricabilis is part of the theropod group of dinosaurs, the evolutionary ancestors of birds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study is based on an analysis of 19 Jurassic ceratosaurian theropod Limusaurus inextricabilis skeletons, discovered in &amp;quot;death traps&amp;quot; where they became mired in mud, got stuck and died. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their fossils were recovered from Xinjiang in China. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The skeletons ranged in age from baby to adult, showing the pattern of tooth loss over time. The baby skeleton had small, sharp teeth, and the adult skeletons were consistently toothless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;This discovery is important for two reasons,&amp;quot; said James Clark, Professor at the George Washington University, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;First, it's very rare to find a growth series from baby to adult dinosaurs. Second, this unusually dramatic change in anatomy suggests there was a big shift in Limusaurus' diet from adolescence to adulthood.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, these fossils indicate that baby Limusaurus could have been carnivores or omnivores while the adults were herbivores, as they would have needed teeth to chew meat but not plants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chemical makeup in the fossils' bones supports the theory of a change in diet between babies and adults. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fossils also could help to show how theropods such as birds lost their teeth, initially through changes during their development from babies to adults, the researchers noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study was published in the journal Current Biology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;rt/in/vt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Kolkata, Dec 23 (IANS) A young Indian researcher, whose presentation integrated a popular Khasi folk tale with scientific findings to explain the occurrence of a particular parasitic worm in northeast India, has won the top honour in the EURAXESS Science Slam India contest for teaching current science to a diverse audience in an entertaining way.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Science Slam is a science communication format where young scientists explain their research projects in short 10-minute talks to a non-expert audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Damanbha Lyngdoh, a doctoral candidate at North Eastern Hill University-NEHU, Shillong, Meghalaya, impressed judges with his science slam titled &amp;quot;Do not judge a book by its cover - A tale from India's North-East&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Damanbha Lyngdoh has won the first prize in India this year in the fourth edition of the Science Slam India. He will be visiting Brussels (headquarters of the European Union) and a research institute of his choice in the EU,&amp;quot; the organisers said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Science Slam offers a platform for young research talent to showcase their work outside of the formal constraints of a research lab or classroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The finalists are judged on the basis of their ability to capture the audience's attention with a precise, accessible and original introduction to their research topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I presented my slam in story-telling manner along with live performance of playing the Khasi Big Drum or 'Ka Bom' (in Khasi language). The folk tale is adapted to suit the scientific information, and through the folk tale, the scientific knowledge about the diversity of this parasite is elaborated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In addition, the slam highlighted the usefulness of these small and minute parasitic worms (often viewed for their negative aspects), in stabilising the environment and maintaining a balance in mother nature, thereby becoming heroes,&amp;quot; Lyngdoh told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Already in its fourth installment, the annual science communication competition of the EU-funded EURAXESS Links network has taken place this autumn in Brazil, China and India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winners can also try to get one Marie Sklodowska-Curie fellowship or a European Research Council (ERC) grant, both actions funded by the European Union Research and Innovation Programme Horizon 2020, the organisers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sgh/sm/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 23 (IANS) The wait of hatching eggs on the wrist is now over as Pokemon Go is finally available on Apple Watch.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement of the Apple Watch version of the game by the end of the year was made in September by US-based software company and developer of the gaming app Niantic. On Wednesday, the developers, in an official blog post, announced that the game is finally available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Apple Watch and Pokemon GO integration, users can log each play session as a workout, with gameplay counting toward personal activity rings and receive notifications about nearby Pokemon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users can count distance toward hatching Pokemon Eggs and receiving Candy with their Buddy Pokemon. Once they encounter a Pokemon, they can catch it from their iPhone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;You can receive notifications about PokeStops nearby and collect items from them and receive notifications when Eggs hatch and medals are awarded,&amp;quot; the developers said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, an email circulated through Reddit, supposedly sent by a Niantic customer service agent, claimed that the &amp;quot;port for the Apple Watch has been shelved&amp;quot; and that development had been stopped unless the demand increased.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the developers had denied the reports saying, &amp;quot;Development on Pokemon Go continues, as it has since before the Apple announcement. We will have more news on the product soon.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/ksk/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Mumbai, Dec 22 (IANS) Google, in collabration with Railtel, on Thursday rolled out free WiFi service at Udhagamandalam (Ooty) station in Tamil Nadu, taking to 100 the railway stations where it offers high speed internet to an estimated 10 million people.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\&amp;quot;We are really excited about reaching this milestone and it is an incredible feeling to look back and see how far we\'ve come since we announced that we were partnering with Indian Railways and RailTel to provide WiFi at 400 railway stations throughout the country,\&amp;quot; Gulzar Azad, Country Head - Connectivity, Google India said in a statement. 

\&amp;quot;But what has really inspired us are the stories of how people are using this high-speed access to the full and open internet. 

\&amp;quot;They are using Railwire WiFi to be more productive with their time and to get things done more efficiently,\&amp;quot; he added.

In January, Google launched its first free WiFi services at Mumbai\'s Mumbai Central station.

According to Google, over 10 million people who pass through these stations every day now have an access to fast Internet speed to stream (or offline) an HD video, research their destination or download a new book or game for the journey ahead. 

With over 5 million monthly users, the Google Railtel Wifi is helping millions of Indians discover the benefits of Internet with 15,000 first time users connecting to the network everyday.

Google has partnered for the project with RailTel which owns the railway cable network across India. 

Google will continue to deploy the high speed WiFi in the next 300 stations. 

In addition to this, Google has also introduced Google Station, which gives partners an easy set of tools to roll-out WiFi hotspots in public places.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 22 (IANS) Taking a step towards making India cleaner, Minister of Urban Development (MoUD) M. Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday launched a Google Map toilet locator to help people find access to clean public restrooms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app, designed by Google, will make information available through a mobile application about thousands of public toilets throughout two locations now -- Delhi NCR and Madhya Pradesh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naidu at the launch said that 504 cities and towns, which also include four million-plus cities, have achieved the status of being free of open defecation, and a total of 739 cities and towns have committed themselves to achieve the status by March next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Sikkim have declared all cities and towns Open Defecation Free (ODF), while Kerala is set to become ODF by March 2018. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app will have listings covering Delhi NCR, including Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Noida and Faridabad, and Bhopal and Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Toilets can be located not just through the app, but on the desktop as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google, the technology and software giant, which built the app working in tandem with the Urban Development Ministry, will work closely with the ministry to keep adding to the maps the data location regarding address and opening hours of over 4,000 communal and public restrooms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When you search for 'public toilet' on Google Maps in an area where the service is available, you'll see a list of restrooms near you, including the respective address and opening hours,&amp;quot; Sanket Gupta, Product Manager, Google Maps, said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For instance, if you're travelling on the National Highway 8 in Gurugram, locating a public toilet can be challenging and most often the only option is going to nearby restaurants and cafes. Having this information handy can make things much easier,&amp;quot; he added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This service will be accessible to users both in English and Hindi language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vn/lok/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 22 (IANS) Riding on the free voice and data offers, Reliance Jio Infocomm's subscriber base may touch 100 million by March 2017 end said Nitin Soni, Director at Fitch Ratings. However, it may even shrink once the telecom operator starts charging its customers, he added.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We think that Jio is adopting a very sound strategy of offering free voice and text services and free data till the end of March to bolster its subscriber base. They currently have 52-55 million subscribers and it could well increase to 100 million by end of March, but we will need to remember that these are free services,&amp;quot; Soni told BTVi in an interview.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;So as long as it is free, even a customer who is a customer of Airtel or Idea will still take a free Jio SIM to enjoy free services for the next three months. But I think there will be some churn when Jio will start charging from April 1 and that churn may well reduce the subscriber base by 5-10 per cent,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched in September, Jio was offering its customers free voice and data till December 31, 2016, which it has now extended till March 31, 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But I think at that time the price will be the sole determinant for a customer whether they want to shift to their second SIM on Jio or whether they want to retain their existing SIM with the incumbent. And at that time, the customer will decide how much they are going to pay on a monthly basis to the telecom operator and if Jio at that time is cheaper than the incumbents, then they might as well shift to Jio,&amp;quot; Soni said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But I think there will be a slew of other offers, which we believe will come in the next three months to further attract subscribers and incumbents will obviously take efforts to retain their existing subscriber base and not allow their premium subscriber base to churn over to Jio,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about consolidation in the telecom space, Soni said the telecom industry cannot afford more than four to five participants in the long run.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We also believe that Reliance Jio entry into the industry will hasten consolidation, given the competitive intensity has notched quite high now and they have recently extended the offer to March 31.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The consolidation has been going on, we have seen Reliance Communications acquiring MTS, and then merging its operations with Aircel. And some of the weaker telcos are looking also to exit the market. But we believe that there could be some more consolidation in the medium term,&amp;quot; said Soni.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said Idea Cellular could face a lot of challenges as it does not have 100 per cent 4G spectrum asset on a pan-India basis. &amp;quot;They could also look to do some merger and acquisition activity to strengthen its competitive position.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;And whenever a new entrant comes into this industry, it negatively impacts the weaker telecom company first. We believe that Idea could be well affected in the next 12-24 months and which is the reason we think that they could do some M&amp;A activity to consolidate their position.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soni said Fitch Ratings views the outlook for the entire sector as negative for 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We believe that data tariff will fall by 15-20 per cent because of competitive intensity coming along from Jio. But Airtel is a well established and entrenched incumbent in this market.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said, Airtel with lot of spectrum asset on 900 MHz is well placed to compete against Jio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;ag/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 22 (IANS) At a time when cyber security has become paramount for digital enterprises, Cisco India on Thursday announced three new initiatives to help the country build a transparent and secure digital infrastructure environment.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cisco will open a new Security Operations Centre (SOC) in Pune which will provide services ranging from monitoring and management to comprehensive threat solutions and hosted security that can be customised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The $49.24 billion company also launched a Cisco Cyber Range Lab at its Gurugram facility which will provide specialised technical training workshops to help security staff build the skills and experience necessary to combat new-age cyber threats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognising that cybersecurity is critical to India's drive to digitise its economy, Cisco's global Security &amp;amp; Trust Organization (S&amp;TO) and Cisco India announced the formation of Cisco S&amp;TO-India that will help the government shape the national cybersecurity strategy and initiatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To achieve this, Cisco and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's (MeitY) Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in the presence of Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;In light of rapidly evolving cyber tactics and shared risks in cyberspace, the need to work side-by-side with industry partners on pressing cyber-challenges becomes increasingly important. We are happy to have Cisco collaborate with us to enhance the security of India's digital infrastructure,&amp;quot; Prasad noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the MoU, Cisco and CERT-In will establish a threat intelligence sharing programme wherein personnel from Cisco and CERT-In will work together to address digital threats and learn new approaches to enhance cybersecurity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cisco's &amp;quot;Active Threat Analytics&amp;quot; provides round-the-clock monitoring and advanced-analytics capabilities combined with industry-leading threat intelligence and expert investigators to rapidly detect advanced threats. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cisco has three Security Operations Centres worldwide -- Poland, the US and Japan. With India as the fourth location, this structure will allow Cisco to provide 24-hour service for customers regardless of time zone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As India digitises, security will become fundamental to seizing the unprecedented opportunities for businesses, cities and citizens. Cisco is committed to enable a digital-ready infrastructure and security everywhere. Today's cybersecurity announcements reaffirm Cisco's long-term commitment to India,&amp;quot; added Dinesh Malkani, President, Cisco India and SAARC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;By 2020, the Indian digital payments industry will grow 10 times and mobile transactions will grow 90 per cent per year by 2020. As of 2016, three new Indians join internet every second and by 2030, one billion Indians will be online so digital security is paramount,&amp;quot; Malkani told reporters here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, Cisco Network Academy programme has trained 122,000 students and is committed to train an additional 250,000 students by 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per a Cisco report, there are more than one million unfulfilled security jobs worldwide currently. To help increase the pool of talent with critical cybersecurity proficiency, the company announced a $10 million Global Cybersecurity Scholarship globally in June.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/na/dg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 22 (IANS) Taking a step towards making India cleaner, Minister of Urban Development (MoUD) M. Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday launched a Google Map toilet locator to help people find access to clean public restrooms.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app, designed by Google, will make information available through a mobile application about thousands of public toilets throughout two locations now -- Delhi NCR and Madhya Pradesh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Naidu at the launch said that 504 cities and towns, which also include four million-plus cities, have achieved the status of being free of open defecation, and a total of 739 cities and towns have committed themselves to achieve the status by March next year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Sikkim have declared all cities and towns Open Defecation Free (ODF), while Kerala is set to become ODF by March 2018. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The app will have listings covering Delhi NCR, including Ghaziabad, Gurugram, Noida and Faridabad, and Bhopal and Indore in Madhya Pradesh. Toilets can be located not just through the app, but on the desktop as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google, the technology and software giant, which built the app working in tandem with the Urban Development Ministry, will work closely with the ministry to keep adding to the maps the data location regarding address and opening hours of over 4,000 communal and public restrooms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;When you search for 'public toilet' on Google Maps in an area where the service is available, you'll see a list of restrooms near you, including the respective address and opening hours,&amp;quot; Sanket Gupta, Product Manager, Google Maps, said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;For instance, if you're travelling on the National Highway 8 in Gurugram, locating a public toilet can be challenging and most often the only option is going to nearby restaurants and cafes. Having this information handy can make things much easier,&amp;quot; he added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This service will be accessible to users both in English and Hindi language.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vn/ksk/vt&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Dhar/Jhabua/Khargone (Madhya Pradesh): Santosh Bavash, 30, said he knew about the internet. &amp;quot;Ive heard it tells you about the future,&amp;quot; he told IndiaSpend when we spoke to the short and thin labourer, from the village of Gyanpura, in the western district of Dhar, in Madhya Pradesh (MP), one of Indias poorest states.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;After the withdrawal of Rs 14 lakh crore - 86 per cent by value of Indian currency in circulation - the government has pushed for digital payments to counter the lack of notes in the economy. Of the 28 tribals IndiaSpend met in a state with more tribals than any other, all but two had a bank account (92.8 per cent), 17 had a personal cell phone and knew how to use it (60.7 per cent), six owned an ATM card and knew how to use it (21.4 per cent) and two knew about the internet (7.1 per cent), an indication of the the gulf between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of a &amp;quot;digital&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;cashless&amp;quot; economy and the reality in India's most disadvantaged areas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;India has 104 million tribals, 8.6 per cent of the total population. MP has 14.69 per cent of India's tribal population (15.3 million). Tribals have lower access to banking services, lower income, education levels, and health outcomes than the rest of the population, according to data from Census 2011, and the socio-economic caste census.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Why tribals are more unprepared than other Indians for the cashless era&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A small group of men and women sat on a raised platform, as a child played on a makeshift swing hanging from a tree. To one side lay farmland, to the other, houses. This was the village of Footiya, in the MP district of Jhabua, along the border with Gujarat. Footiya is inhabited predominantly by adivasis, or tribals, and does not have a post office, a cooperative or commercial bank, an ATM, or a public phone booth, according to information from Census 2011.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Zumla (he uses only one name), a tall, well-built man with a white moustache, also sat under the tree. He said he had had a bank account for years now, but rarely used it because he had little money to deposit into the account, and because going to a bank took very long. It takes him an hour to walk to the nearest bank branch, about 6 km from the village, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;I am anguthachaap,&amp;quot; Zumla, a Bhil tribal with a white turban, added in Hindi, using the term for a thumb impression, a sign of illiteracy. &amp;quot;I use a chequebook (he meant passbook) to put in money and take out money, but I don't know how to use an ATM,&amp;quot; said Zumla, dressed in a grey shirt paired with a white dhoti tied above the knees. &amp;quot;If I can't read, how do I know what buttons to press?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The district of Jhabua - over 91 per cent of all households here are classified as scheduled tribes - has one of the lowest rural literacy levels in the state. Less than half of the population in the district (40.1 per cent), and less than one third of the women (29.8 per cent), in rural areas is literate, according to 2011 Census data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, tribals have a lower literacy rate than the rest of the population. About half of the tribal population (50.6 per cent) in MP is literate, compared to 70.63 per cent for the population overall, according to data from Census 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tribals lag other Indians in use of banking services&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Less than 45 per cent of scheduled tribe households used banking services in 2011, compared to over 58 per cent of the whole population, according to Census data.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A lack of jobs and abject poverty meant that some tribals had no money to put into a bank account. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On average, the tribal population earns less than the rest of the population. In MP, 1 per cent of tribal households pay income tax - one sign of a lower income - as compared to 2.4 per cent of the non-tribal population, as IndiaSpend reported in July 2016. Along with Odisha, MP has the second lowest percentage of tribal households who pay income tax, based on data from the socio-economic caste census.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;ATMs, cellphones, bank accounts are, often, unknown territory&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;A lack of knowledge about ATMs, cellphones or bank accounts emerged as one of the main reasons for the reluctance to use bank accounts and ATMs more often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who used ATM cards were either educated, or had been helped by either a friend or a bank official.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;In general, researchers have found a strong correlation between the spread of banking and reduction in poverty, as a 2003 paper found in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IndiaSpend found that some in tribal MP had opened bank accounts to access direct transfers from the government. It was unclear whether a bank account led to enhanced access to government subsidies, or bank accounts were a consequence of awareness of government subsidies.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Those who get government subsidies use bank accounts, but only 1/3rd use cellphones&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, those better acquainted with government programmes used their bank accounts to access money from direct transfers of government subsidies or doles.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Though most households IndiaSpend visited had at least one cellphone, mostly with a male or younger family member, cellphone ownership was still not universal. A little over 31 per cent of tribal households owned a cellphone in 2011, compared to 53.2 per cent  of the entire population, according to Census data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In all this, some said demonetisation would eventually be beneficial to the poor. &amp;quot;The black money that has come out, Modi might distribute it. He might approve the building of a house or something (for the poor),&amp;quot; said Mithun, a labourer from Dhar district.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(In arrangement with IndiaSpend.org, a data-driven, non-profit, public interest journalism platform, with whom Shreya Shah is a reporter/editor. The views expressed are those of IndiaSpend. Feedback at respond@indiaspend.org) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS/IndiaSpend&lt;br&gt;shreya/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 22 (IANS) Researchers have created a bacteria-powered battery on a single sheet of paper that can power disposable electronics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The manufacturing technique reduces fabrication time and cost, and the design could revolutionise the use of bio-batteries as a power source in remote, dangerous and resource-limited areas, according to the scientists from Binghamton University, State University of New York.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Papertronics have recently emerged as a simple and low-cost way to power disposable point-of-care diagnostic sensors,&amp;quot; said Assistant Professor Seokheun Choi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Stand-alone and self-sustained, paper-based, point-of-care devices are essential to providing effective and life-saving treatments in resource-limited settings,&amp;quot; Choi noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one half of a piece of chromatography paper, the researchers placed a ribbon of silver nitrate underneath a thin layer of wax to create a cathode. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They then made a reservoir out of a conductive polymer on the other half of the paper, which acted as the anode. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once properly folded and a few drops of bacteria-filled liquid are added, the microbes' cellular respiration powered the battery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The device requires layers to include components, such as the anode, cathode and PEM (proton exchange membrane),&amp;quot; Choi explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would take millions of paper batteries to power a common 40-watt light bulb, but on the battlefield or in a disaster situation, usability and portability is paramount. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The technique was described online in the journal Advanced Materials Technologies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New Delhi, Dec 22 (IANS) With mounting revenue losses amid too many players fighting to grab a pie, exits will surpass entrants in the Indian smartphone market in 2017, analysts said on Thursday.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are nearly 250 million unique smartphone users in the country and by the end of 2016, there will be 280 million Indians with these devices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;With declining margins amid cut-throat competition, we predict some smartphone players will call it quits in 2017. We estimate that number of exits in the smartphone market will exceed number of entrants in the next year,&amp;quot; Tarun Pathak, Senior Analyst, Mobile Devices and Ecosystems at New Delhi-based Counterpoint Research, told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;While some signs of this trend already started happening, we predict it will only intensify in 2017 and lead to consolidation in smartphone market,&amp;quot; Pathak added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the exits will be seen at the entry-level smartphone segment, involving regional players which were unable to generate volume and, at the same time, were unable to scale up their portfolio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As tech companies strive to connect the next billion, India will lead the way in 2017 where new disruptive start-ups will emerge and regional knowhow and strength in developing vernacular apps to entice first-time mobile users will be the key, analysts said on Thursday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;10K-20K smartphone was the fastest growing smartphone segment (+86 per cent) in 2016 and is likely to be the fastest in 2017 too owing to users upgrading from sub-10k category to mid-end segment,&amp;quot; said Karn Chauhan, an analyst with Counterpoint Research. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With replacement rate of smartphones increasing and new launches happening more frequently, the experts also see refurbished and hands-down smartphone market to grow in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Samsung ramps up its OLED production with other players also setting up manufacturing plants for OLED production, the competition for OLED screen size with sharper and narrow bezels is likely to intensify in 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Apart from this, we will also see Dual camera, Front flash and quick-charge technology leading from the specification perspective in India,&amp;quot; Chauhan noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India handset manufacturing will continue to evolve from assembly towards end-to-end manufacturing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;As per a Counterpoint Research-IIM Bangalore study, the local value addition in India during 2016 was 6 per cent which is estimated to grow to 10 percent in 2017,&amp;quot; Pathak told IANS.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Demonetisation has given strong momentum to the adoption of digital payments via smartphones -- a trend which is likely to be more significant in 2017, the experts noted.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;na/bg&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 22 (IANS) After a trapdoor spider, a speckled freshwater darter (fish), a parasitic hairworm and an extinct lizard, outgoing US President Barack Obama now has a new species on his name: a coral-reef fish.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists have named a new set of small pink and yellow coral-reef fish -- found exclusively within the marine protected area in Hawaii -- in honour of Obama.  

The fish now bears the formal scientific name \&amp;quot;Tosanoides obama\&amp;quot;.

President Obama also has several species from other locales named after him: a trapdoor spider, a speckled freshwater darter , a parasitic hairworm and an extinct lizard.

The fish was discovered during a June 2016 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expedition to Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument in the Hawaiian Islands. 

On August 26, at the urging of the Hawaii Democrat Senator Brian Schatz, and various conservationists and marine scientists, President Obama had expanded the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. 

At 582,578 square miles, it is the largest permanent marine protected area on Earth. 

\&amp;quot;We decided to name this fish after President Obama to recognise his efforts to protect and preserve the natural habitat, including its expansion,\&amp;quot; said lead author Richard Pyle, Bishop Museum scientist. 

\&amp;quot;The expansion of Papahanaumokuakea adds a layer of protection to one of the last great wilderness areas on Earth,\&amp;quot; Pyle added.

Male obamas have a distinctive spot on the dorsal fin near the tail, which is blue around the edge and red with yellow stripes in the centre. 

\&amp;quot;It is reminiscent of President Obama\'s campaign logo so seemed especially appropriate for the fish to be named in honour of the President,\&amp;quot; Pyle said.

The new species was first discovered and collected on a dive to 300 feet at Kure Atoll, 1200 miles northwest of Honolulu.

It is special because it is the only known species of coral-reef fish endemic to the Monument. 

On September 1, during his trip to Midway Atoll within the Monument, legendary scientist, conservationist and deep ocean explorer Sylvia Earle presented the President a photograph of the fish.  

The study was published in the open-access scientific journal ZooKeys.

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Chennai, Dec 22 (IANS) As the threat looms of Gen Next terming existing brands as their &amp;quot;parents' brand&amp;quot; and seeking newer alternatives, older brands are increasingly seeking to reinforce and reinvent themselves in the digital space to remain alive, a senior official of Google Inc said.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;With eight Google products having around one billion users per month, we help companies build their brands in the digital space,&amp;quot; Gopi Kallayil, Chief Evangelist, Brand Marketing, told IANS here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kallayil said his job does not involve building/promoting Google or its other products, but helping other companies build their brands in the digital space using his company's products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The yoga guru at Google and the author of &amp;quot;The Internet to the Inner-neta&amp;quot;, Kallayil would easily pass as a movie industry personality with his jazzy shoes, designer socks, bright red pants, black shirt and black coat, and few would believe he is a corporate executive -- and that too someone originally from Kerala.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;India is a land of colours. So I decided to wear clothes that are bright coloured. Also, working in Google one need not be very formally dressed,&amp;quot; said Kallayil, who was here to speak at a seminar on &amp;quot;Reaching Out to the Mobile Indian&amp;quot; organised by the Indian Institute of Management-Calcutta Alumni Association, Chennai chapter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the trends in advertising on the internet, Kallayil said there will be more video advertisements in future, but said they would not be intrusive and cited You Tube spots that give the option to skip the ad in four seconds. It should also be noted that most TV commercials are for five seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The major trend is the increase in mobile phones, online videos and the use of artificial intelligence,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Kallayil, by studying what is being searched online and what is trending, one can provide corporates with data that would help them come out with appropriate products and citied how a cosmetics company came out with its product for ombre hair colouring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kallayil sees huge potential in India as the country's internet population is soon expected to overtake that of the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said the company is developing a product for the Indian market that is simple but declined to reveal details.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to him, the digital space or the internet is a great leveller as it offers even a small company in an Indian village an opportunity to market its product globally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Small Indian companies can not only market their products to the Indian diaspora overseas but also to an entirely new market segment if targeted properly. That is where we come in,&amp;quot; Kallayil said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;The cost could be even be as low as zero,&amp;quot; he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said on digital space advertisements can not only be targeted but also appropriately timed whereas this is not the case for television or other media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On what drives innovation at Google, he said nine core principles are distilled from the experiences gained over the last 18 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said the first principle is that innovation comes from anywhere and Google does not have a Chief Innovation Officer like some companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The freedom given to employees does wonders. If an idea is backed up by convincing data then the green signal is given, he said. Focusing on the user is an obsession at Google, he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other principles are Think 10X (making a product 10 times better); Radical solution bordering lunacy; Betting on technical insights; Launch and iterate; 20 per cent time (Employees are free to use 20 per cent of their working time to think about innovative ideas); Having a mission that matters; Fail well and Default to open (open to collaborate with others).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Venkatachari Jagannathan can be contacted at v.jagannathan@ians.in)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;vj/vm/ky/sac&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 22 (IANS) Five years after Apple and Nokia settled a lawsuit, the tech giants have again locked horns over patents with Apple filing an anti-trust lawsuit against third-party companies Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) that act on Nokia's behalf, and the Finland-based firm suing Apple directly.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nokia on Wednesday filed a suit directly against Apple in Europe and the US, claiming the company is still infringing on Nokia patents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lawsuit covers 32 patents, including display, user interface, software and video-coding technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nokia said that since settling that initial case, Apple has &amp;quot;declined subsequent offers made by Nokia to license other [parts] of its patented inventions, which are used by many Apple products.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its lawsuit filed on Tuesday, Apple argued that Nokia already has agreements to license its patents for fair and reasonable terms, also know as &amp;quot;FRAND&amp;quot;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;But Nokia is transferring these patents to PAEs in order to aggressively pursue money,&amp;quot; a report in The Verge said on Thursday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple said that this should not be allowed because it is &amp;quot;anticompetitive and abusive&amp;quot; to the Cupertino-based company and other technology firms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple is behind the PAEs that Nokia has partnered with to pursue additional patent money.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Apple, these companies, which include Acacia Research and Conversant Property Management, are &amp;quot;conspiring with Nokia in a scheme to diffuse and abuse and, as the PAEs and Nokia fully intended, monetise those false promises by extracting exorbitant non-FRAND royalties in way Nokia could not.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;PAEs have reportedly sued Apple at least 12 times based off former Nokia patents. Acacia has sued Apple more than 40 times based off patents from Nokia and other companies,&amp;quot; the report said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2011, the two companies settled a patent fight with Apple over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that committed Apple to make a one-time payment to the company and to pay regular royalties in the future, the New York Times reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The companies also agreed to withdraw complaints against each other with the International Trade Commission over the use of intellectual property.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;sku/na/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>New York, Dec 22 (IANS) Facebook is neither a &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; media company, nor it is a &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; technology company, CEO Mark Zuckerburg has said, adding that it is a new kind of platform.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zuckerburg on Wednesday invited his 82 million followers on Facebook to sit in on his discussion with Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sheryl Sandbeg on Facebook Live where he tried to explain the nature of Facebook and attempted to answer several much-asked questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We build technology and we feel responsible for how it is used. We do not write the news that people read on the platform, but at the same time we know that we do a lot more than just distributing the news. We are an important part of the public discourse,&amp;quot; Zuckerburg said on Facebook Live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, earlier this year in an event in Italy, Zuckerburg had said that Facebook was a technology company and not just a media company, according to a report in Digital Trends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Critics have blamed the social networking giant Facebook for influencing the US-elections in favour of President-elect Donald Trump by circulating a &amp;quot;host of fake news stories about political topics.&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Reflecting on 2016, this is just something that I am proud that people in this company take so seriously,&amp;quot; Zuckerburg said on the issue of fake news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;qd/gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Washington, Dec 22 (IANS) A NASA satellite instrument orbiting Earth that can see through fog, clouds and darkness has given scientists their first continuous look at the boom-and-bust, or peak and decline, cycles of phytoplankton -   foundation of the ocean's food web vital for life to exist on earth.&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results showed that small, environmental changes in polar food webs significantly influence the boom-and-bust cycles of phytoplankton. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers believe that the findings - published in the journal Nature Geoscience - will supply important data for ecosystem management, commercial fisheries and our understanding of the interactions between Earth's climate and key ocean ecosystems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;It's really important for us to understand what controls these boom-and-bust cycles, and how they might change in the future so we can better evaluate the implications on all other parts of the food web,&amp;quot; said Michael Behrenfeld, a marine plankton expert at Oregon State University in Corvallis, US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coastal economies and wildlife depend on what happens to tiny green plants, or phytoplankton, at the base of the ocean food chain. Commercial fisheries, marine mammals and birds all depend on phytoplankton blooms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phytoplankton also influence Earth's carbon cycle. Through photosynthesis, they absorb a great deal of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the upper ocean and produce oxygen, which is vital for life on Earth. This reduces the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NASA's Cloud-Aerosol LIdar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), an instrument aboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite launched in 2006, uses a laser to take measurements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scientists used the instrument to continuously monitor plankton in polar regions from 2006 to 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;CALIOP was a game-changer in our thinking about ocean remote sensing from space,&amp;quot; said Chris Hostetler, a research scientist at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;We were able to study the workings of the high-latitude ocean ecosystem during times of year when we were previously completely blind,&amp;quot; Hostetler noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--IANS&lt;br&gt;gb/vm&lt;/p&gt;</p>]]></content>

<content><![CDATA[ <p>Title: How the Zebra Got its Stripes And Other Darwinian Just So Stories; Author: Leo Grasset (translated by Barbara Mellor); Publisher: Profile Books/Hachette India; Pages: 162; Price: Rs 499&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was birthplace of the human race but that is not the only contribution of Africa to life on our planet. On its sprawling savannah can be seen many intriguing and inexplicable natural phenomena, spanning morphology (stripes/long necks), behaviour (deer warning signals) and habitat (termite mounds), which show how it still is a laboratory of evolution. But the reasons or explanations are still elusive.

Why do giraffes have such elongated necks, and zebras are striped (and how does this help in constructing stealth ships)? Why are buffalo herds a model of incipient democracy, and elephants of dictatorships? What does the deer response to danger teach us about human crowd behaviour and what was wrongly depicted in the Disney hit \&amp;quot;The Lion King\&amp;quot;?

These are among questions that French natural scientist Leo Grasset seeks to answer in this informed and engaging update of Rudyard Kipling\'s whimsical stories, but also showing how complex these phenomena are and \&amp;quot;answers\&amp;quot; are more of probabilities than certainties.

Citing eminent evolutionary biologist and geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky, who held that \&amp;quot;nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\&amp;quot;, he notes that \&amp;quot;sometimes, when the questions being explored are at the cutting edge of scientific research, the light of evolution casts shadows that are hard to decipher!\&amp;quot;

Grasset, who terms himself a \&amp;quot;punk scientist par excellence\&amp;quot; and runs the blog \'Dans les testicules de Darwin\' devoted to biology, testosterone and rock\'n\'roll, is also one of France\'s leading up-and-coming evolutionary biologists. He contends that of all the laws governing evolution of human beings, selection is the most powerful.

This, as he goes on to show, is \&amp;quot;especially evident on the great African savannah\&amp;quot; where if one individual possesses a slight advantage over the other, it will produce more young, which if inheriting and passing on the same advantage, will ultimately dominate the species\' gene pool while the other disadvantaged ones go into \&amp;quot;evolutionary oblivion\&amp;quot;.

Admitting this may be a bit simplified as things are not very straightfoward in the real world, he seeks to illustrates the theory with the case of the male nipple, and two rival reasons that seek to explain it. He goes on to two more oddities -- the penis-shaped clitoris of the female hyena, horns of the female buffalo and some other quadrupeds -- and continues to explore more bizarre sexual attributes such as male impalas\' behaviour in the breeding season.

In explanation, Grasset notes that \&amp;quot;some apparently \'natural\' characteristics\&amp;quot; do not necessarily have a function, while some others, that seem to have no purpose, are the fruit of the important purpose of selection and do have some important functions.

\&amp;quot;Evolution is a complicated phenomenon,\&amp;quot; he holds, noting it \&amp;quot;makes organs and appendages disappear, creates new ones and repurposes existing ones for different functions\&amp;quot;. In light of all this, \&amp;quot;it is sometimes difficult for biologists to understand the functions of the shapes and appearances of the creatures they study\&amp;quot; and they are too ready to put out multiple, even contradictory hypotheses.

\&amp;quot;Perhaps researchers are looking for simple explanations, whereas the exuberant creativity of evolution requires something far more complex,\&amp;quot; he says, and proves it in attempts to explain, with a lot of wit, the reasons for the giraffe neck, the gazelle\'s random flight, the zebra\'s stripes (which can also help it to escape anti-tank missiles!).

Grasset also introduces, with much similar wit, the marvels of termites\' \&amp;quot;air conditioning\&amp;quot;, the impalas\' \&amp;quot;Mexican Wave\&amp;quot;, the contrary political systems of buffalo and elephants, and the antelopes\' sexual manipulation as well as extraordinary creatures like the dung-beetle and the honey badger, habits like the elephants\' skill at discerning sounds, including of humans, and finally, his attempts, in a Zimbabwean game reserve, at finding out if zebras have individual personalities.

Also key are his investigations into the human effect on environment and the rest of the animal world as we learn that nature is not only stranger than what we think but much more stranger than we can think -- and amazingly responsive and resilient too.
